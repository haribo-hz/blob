Reactivity 3.4.5 - alkenes are susceptible to electrophilic attack because of the high electron density of the carbon-carbon double bond. these reactions lead to electrophilic addition  
  
- alkenes have the general formula $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n}}$ and are **unsaturated hydrocarbons** with a $\ce{C=C}$ bond  
$$  
\ce{H_{2}C}\textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\ce{\overset{ \sigma }{ \underset{\pi}{ = } }}}{CH_{2}}  
$$  
- alkenes are more reactive than alkanes as the double bond has a higher electron density  
- the reaction occurs at the double bond  
- the pi bond is selectively broken, creating 2 new bonding positions  
  
###### addition of water  
- **hydration** converts the alkene into an alcohol  
- water is a poor electrophile  
	- hydration requires the use of a strong acid catalyst  
	- typically $\ce{H_{2}SO_{4}}$  
$$  
\ce{\underset{ethene}{ CH_{2}CH_{2} }\xrightarrow[H_{2}O]{\ce{H_{2}SO_{4}(conc.)}}\underset{ethanol}{ CH_{3}CH_{2}OH }}  
$$  
###### addition of halogens  
- halogens react with alkenes to produce dihalogeno compounds  
- these reactions happen quickly at room temperature  
	- accompanied by loss of colour of reacting halogen

- bromine water is often used to distinguish between alkanes and alkenes  
	- alkanes react with bromine water through a radical mechanism (requiring UV light to initiate the reaction)  
	- alkenes react readily with $\ce{Br_{2}}$ (due to the presence of pi bonds), so the reaction will happen in the dark  
  
###### addition of halogen halides  
- $\ce{HCl}$ and $\ce{HBr}$ react with alkenes to produce halogenoalkanes  
- these reactions take place rapidly at room temperature

all hydrogen halides are able to react in this way, but the reactivity is in the order decreasing strength of the $\ce{H-X}$ bond. weaker bonds react more readily  
- $\ce{HI>HBr>HCl}$   
  
alkenes can react with specific electrophiles to make different classes of organic compounds, such as:  
- alcohols  
- halogenoalkanes  
- dihalogenoalkanes  
  
these products can be further converted into other classes of compounds, making alkene very useful starting molecules in **organic synthetic pathways**
