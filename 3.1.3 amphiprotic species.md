Reactivity 3.1.3 - some species can act as both Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases  
  
**amphiprotic substances** can act as both Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases  
- to act as an acid: they must be able to dissociate and release $\ce{H+}$  
- to act as a base: they must be able to accept $\ce{H+}$, must have lone pair of electrons  
  
**amphoteric substances** can react with both acids and bases  
  
moving left to right across a period, the oxides transition from basic metal oxides through **amphoteric** oxides, to acidic oxides  
  
nitrogen and sulfur form several different oxides, known as $\ce{NO_{x}}$ and $\ce{SO_{x}}$, released from the burning of fossil fuels.  
  
these oxides can react with moisture in the atmosphere to form weak acids and react further to form strong acids.  
  
eg:  
$$  
\ce{2NO_{2}(g) +H_{2}O(l)\to HNO_{2}(aq) +HNO_{3}(aq)}  
$$  
this lowers the $\text{pH}$ causing acid rain  
##### challenge questions  
2. at ambient temperature, the polyatomic ion $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ may not be considered truly amphiprotic as its basic properties dominate - losing $\ce{H+}$ in solution is unlikely due to the instability of $\ce{O^2-}$ in water. however, when a metal hydroxide such as magnesium hydroxide is heated, it decomposes as follows:  
$$  
\ce{Mg(OH)2(s)\to MgO(s) +H_{2}O(g)}  
$$  
	derive the ionic form of this reaction to analyse how the hydroxide ion is showing amphiprotic behaviour here  
  
$$  
\ce{2OH^{-}\to O^{2-} +H_{2}O}  
$$  
$$  
\ce{OH- +H+\to H_{2}O}  
$$
