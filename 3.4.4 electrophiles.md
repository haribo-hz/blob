Reactivity 3.4.4 - an electrophile is a reactant that forms a bond to its reaction partner (the nucleophile) by accepting both bonding electrons from that reaction partner  
  
**electrophiles**:  
- are a reactant that forms a covalent bond to its reaction partner (the nucleophile) by accepting both bonding electrons  
- are typically electron deficient, or contain an electron-deficient region  
	- may carry a positive charge or partial positive charge  
eg:  
- neutral: $\ce{HX, X_{2},H_{2}O,RX}$  
- cations: $\ce{H+, NO_{2}+, NO+, CH_{3}+, R+}$  
  
neutral molecules can be electrophiles as they contain electron-deficient areas that result from **instantaneous dipoles** or **permanent dipoles**
