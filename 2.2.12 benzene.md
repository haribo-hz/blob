Structure 2.2.12 - benzene, $\ce{C_{6}H_{6}}$, is an important example of a molecule that has resonance  
  
- 6 carbon atoms in a hexagonal ring  
- triangular planar arrangement with 120Ëš bond angles

###### evidence for the accepted structure of benzene  
benzene's structure can be explained through a combination of physical and chemical properties
