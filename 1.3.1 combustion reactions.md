Reactivity 1.3.1 - reactive metals, non-metals and organic compounds undergo combustion reactions when heated in oxygen

$\text{s}$ block metals form ionic oxides which are basic
$\text{p}$ block non-metals generally form covalent oxides which are acidic

in complete combustion, the products are fully oxidised

combustion of organic compounds that contain other elements produces a range of other products

##### challenge questions
1. a compound containing carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen was analysed by combustion. $0.20\pu{ g}$ of the compound produced $0.456\pu{ g }$ of carbon dioxide and $0.248\pu{ g}$ of water. identify the empirical formula of the compound.

$\ce{C_{3}H_{8}N}$
