Reactivity 3.2.10 - functional groups in organic compounds may undergo reduction  
  
###### reduction of carbonyl compounds  
- in organic chemistry, it is useful to analyse redox reactions in terms of gain and loss of oxygen or hydrogen  
  
  
- oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones involves the removal of 2 $\ce{H}$ atoms  
- ketones can be can be reduced to secondary alcohols by adding 2 $\ce{H}$ atoms  
	- reducing agent used provides hydrogens in the form $\ce{H-}$ and $\ce{H+}$ ions
