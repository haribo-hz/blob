1.4.4 the empirical formula of a compound gives the simplest ratio of atoms of each element present in that compound. the molecular formula gives the actual number of atoms of each element present in a molecule.

**empirical formula** is the simplest whole-number ratio of the atoms of each element in a compound

the formulas of all ionic compounds are empirical formulas

**anhydrous salt** + **water of crystallisation** = **hydrated salt**

converting percentage by mass to empirical formulas
- divide the percentage mass of each element by its molar mass, $M$, to convert it to moles
- divide the moles of each element by the smallest number to give the ratio of moles
- approximate to the nearest whole number

converting empirical formulas to percentage by mass
i.e. what is the percentage by mass of $N$, $H$ and $O$ in the compound ammonium nitrate, $\ce{NH_{4}NO_{3}}$?

$M=80.043\text{g}$

$\ce{[N]}$ = $\frac{14.0067\times2}{80.043}=0.350=35.0\%$ (m/m)
$\ce{[H]}$ = $\frac{4}{80.043}=0.0500=5.00\%$
$\ce{[O]}$ = $\frac{16\times 3}{80.043}=0.600=60\%$

the molecular formula of a compound gives the actual numbers of atoms in a molecule. formulas that show all the atoms present in a molecule are called **molecular formulas**

##### challenge questions
3. A fertiliser has an N-P-K rating of 18-51-20. Use the information in the box above to determine the percentage by mass of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium present.

%N in fertiliser is 18%

%P in fertiliser is 22.3% $0.51 \times\frac{30.9738\times 2}{30.9738\times 2+16.00\times 5}=0.223$

%K in fertiliser is 16.6% $0.2\times \frac{39.0983\times 2}{39.0983\times 2+16.00}=0.166$

###### interesting
A 0.5438g sample of a compound known to contain only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen was burned completely in oxygen. The products were 1.0390g $\ce{CO_2}$ and 0.6369g $\ce{H_2O}$. The compound has a molar mass of $46.08\text{g mol}^{-1}$. Determine the empirical formula and the molecular formula of the compound.

$$
\begin{align}
n(\ce{C)&=n(\ce{CO_{2}})=\frac{1.0390}{12+2*16}\\&=0.02361\pu{ mol }} \\
n(\ce{H})&=2\times n(\ce{H_{2}O})=\frac{0.6369}{2\times 1 +16}\\&=0.07076\pu{ mol } \\
m(O)&=0.5438-m(\ce{C})-m(\ce{H}) \\
&=0.5438-0.02361\times 12-0.07076\times 1 \\
&=0.18972\pu{ g } \\
n(O)&=\frac{0.18972}{16} \\
&=0.01186\pu{ mol }
\end{align}
$$
|         | C       | H       | O       |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| mole    | 0.02361 | 0.07076 | 0.01186 |
| ratio   | 1.99    | 5.97    | 1       |
| nearest | 2       | 6       | 1       |

$$
\begin{align}
M_{\text{empirical formula}}&=2\times 12.00+6\times 1+1\times 16.00 \\
&=46=M_{\text{moleculear formula}}
\end{align}
$$

thus, the molecular formula is the same as the empirical formula, which is $\ce{C_{2}H_{6}O}$
