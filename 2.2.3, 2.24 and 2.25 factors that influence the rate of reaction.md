Reactivity 2.2.3 - factors that influence the rate of a reaction include pressure, concentration, surface area, temperature and the presence of a catalyst

Reactivity 2.2.4 - activation energy, $E_{\text{a}}$, is the minimum energy that colliding particles need for a successful collision leading to a reaction

Reactivity 2.2.5 - catalysts increase the rate of reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower $E_{\text{a}}$

###### temperature
increasing **temperature** causes an increase in the average kinetic energy

- increase in collision frequency due to higher kinetic energy
- increase in number of collisions with necessary activation energy (successful collisions)

###### concentration
increasing concentration of reactants increases frequency of collisions between reactant particles and frequency of successful collisions

###### pressure
increasing pressure in reactions involving gases increases the rate of reaction as it effectively increases the concentration of the gas and frequency of collisions

###### surface area
increasing the surface area allows more contact and higher probability of collisions between reactants.

for example, the reaction between $\ce{CaCO_{3}}$ chips vs $\ce{CaCO_{3}}$ powder with hydrochloric acid.

###### catalyst
a **catalyst** increases the rate of chemical reaction without undergoing chemical change. most catalysts provide an alternative route for the reaction with a lower activation energy.

catalysts bring about an equal reduction in the activation energy of both the forward and revers reactions, so do not change the position of equilibrium or yield, but can increase the *rate* of reactions.

without catalysts, many reactions would proceed too slowly, or need to be conducted at very high temperatures.

*biological* reactions are controlled by catalysts, known as **enzymes**.

catalysis is also an important aspect of green chemistry, replacing stoichiometric reagents and can greatly enhance the selectivity of processes.

catalysts are effective in small quantities and can be reused, so do not contribute to chemical waste, increasing [[Subjects/Chem/notes/2 Reactivity/2 how much, how fast and how far/2.1 the amount of chemical change/2.1.5 atom economy|atom economy]]


##### challenge questions
2. catalysts can be categorised as 'homogeneous' or 'heterogeneous'. a homogeneous catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants. for example, gaseous chlorine radicals catalyse the breakdown of ozone in the stratosphere. a heterogeneous catalyst, such as solid vanadium(V) oxide in the reaction between gaseous sulfur dioxide and oxygen, is in a different phase to the reactants. can you identify which type of catalyst might be more difficult to recover after a reaction and suggest a possible approach for doing so?

homogenous catalysts might be more difficult to recover after a reaction. there are several physical separation methods

solvent extraction or distillation
