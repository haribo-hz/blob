Reactivity 3.3.2 - radicals are produced by homolytic fission, eg.g. of halogens, in the presence of ultraviolet light or heat  
  
- 2 equal radicals  
- equal assignment of electrons  
- endothermic process  
  
**thermolytic fission**  
- low energy  
  
$$  
\ce{X:X\xrightarrow{heat}X\bullet +X\bullet }  
$$  
**photolytic fission**  
- higher energy than thermolytic fission  
$$  
\ce{X:X\xrightarrow{\text{UV}}X\bullet +X\bullet }

###### chlorine radicals and ozone depletion  
- chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)  
- used in aerosols, refrigerants, solvents, plastics  
	- low reactivity  
	- low toxicity in troposphere  
  
entering the stratosphere, they are broken down through photolytic fission  
  
dichlorodifluoromethane  
```smiles  
[F]C([Cl])([Cl])[F]  
```  
  
the chlorine radicals released catalyse the decomposition of ozone, $\ce{O_{3}}$  
  
$$  
\begin{align}  
\ce{  
 &Cl\bullet(g) +O_{3}(g)\to O_{2}(g) +ClO\bullet (g)\\  
 &ClO\bullet (g) +O\bullet (g)\to O_{2} +C\bullet (g)  
}  
\end{align}  
$$  
  
here $\ce{Cl\bullet(g)}$ has acted as a catalyst and the net reaction is  
$$  
\ce{O_{3}(g) +O\bullet (g)\to 2O_{2}(g)}  
$$  
  
- chlorine radicals are particularly harmful as they can catalyse the decomposition thousands of ozone molecules  
- chlorine radicals do not readily react with $\ce{O_{2}}$ in the stratosphere as the $\ce{O=O}$ double bond is stronger than the resonance bond in $\ce{O_{3}}$  
  
##### challenge questions  
1. average bond enthalpies for the $\ce{C-Cl}$ and $\ce{C-F}$ bonds are $324\pu{ kJ mol^{-1}}$ and $492\pu{ kJ mol^{-1}}$ respectively. calculate the wavelengths of UV radiation required to break $\ce{C-Cl}$ and $\ce{C-F}$ bonds.  
  
apply this formula  
$$  
\begin{array}{}  
\text{bond energy per molecule}=\frac{\text{bond enthalpy}}{N_\text{A}}\\  
\lambda=\frac{hc}{E}  
\end{array}  
$$
