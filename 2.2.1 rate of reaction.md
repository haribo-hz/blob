Reactivity 2.2.1 - the rate of reaction is expressed as the change in concentration of a particular reactant/product per unit time  
  
**rate of reaction** describes how quickly a reaction happens  
  
$$  
\begin{align}  
\text{rate of reaction}&=\frac{\text{increase in product concentration}}{\text{time taken}} \\  
&=\frac{\text{decrease in reactant concentration}}{\text{time taken}}  
\end{align}  
$$  
  
$$  
\text{rate of reaction}=\frac{\Delta[\text{P}]}{\Delta t}\text{ or }-\frac{\Delta[\text{R}]}{\Delta t}  
$$  
  
it is worth noting that by convention, rate should be expressed as a positive value.  
  
units are $\pu{ mol dm^{-3} s^{-1}}$  
  
the rate is the greatest at the start as that is when the reactant concentration is the highest. it is common to compare the **initial rate** by taking the tangent at $t=0$  
  
##### methods to measure rate of reaction  
in most cases, the concentration is not measured directly, but through different signals that are related to the changing concentration  
  
###### change in volume of gas produced  
collecting the gas and measuring the change in volume at regular time intervals enables a graph to be plotted of volume against time  
- **gas syringe**  
- displacement of water from an inverted burette (only gases that have low solubility in water)  
- data loggers for continuous monitoring

###### change in mass  
it might be convenient to measure changes in mass with a balance. if the reaction is giving off a gas, the decrease in mass can be measured directly and continuously.

###### change in transmission of light: colorimetry/spectrophotometry  
  
this technique can be used if one of the reactants or products is coloured. sometimes an indicator can be added to generate a coloured compound that can be followed. this allows for continuous readings to be made

with a series of known solutions, the concentration can be found, however, it is often sufficient to record absorbance itself as a function against time  
  
###### change in concentration using titration  
samples are taken from the reaction mixture at regular time intervals and analysed by titration. as titration takes time, the reaction mixture in the sample will continue to react, so must be **quenched**. for example, adding a base to neutralise an acid.  
  
(reaction between hydrogen peroxide and acidified potassium iodide)  
$$  
\ce{H_{2}O_{2}(aq) +2H+(aq) +2I-(aq)\to I_{2}(aq) +2H_{2}O(l)}  
$$  
iodine can be titrated against $\ce{Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}}$. to stop the reaction mixture from continuing to react, $\ce{Na_{2}CO_{3}}$ can be added to neutralise the added acid.  
  
###### change in conductivity  
the total electrical conductivity of a solution depends on the total concentration of its ions and on their charges. conductivity can be measured directly using a conductivity meter. readings can also be converted into the concentrations of ions present with a series of known solutions.  
  
for example:  
$$  
\ce{BrO_{3}-(aq) +5Br-(aq) +6H+(aq)\to 3Br_{2}(aq) +3H_{2}O(l)}   
$$  
  
###### non-continuous methods of detecting change during a reaction: 'clock reactions'  
sometimes it is difficult to record the continuous change in the rate of a reaction. then, the time it takes for a reaction to reach a certain chosen fixed point (something observable) is measured. the time taken to reach this point for the same reaction under different conditions can be compared and used as a means of judging the different rates of reaction.  
  
here, time is used as a dependent variable.  
  
the data obtained give only an average rate over the time interval.  
  
$$  
\ce{Mg(s) +2HCl(aq)\to MgCl_{2}(aq) +H_{2}(g)}  
$$  
- the time taken for a certain size piece of magnesium ribbon to react completely with dilute acid until it is no longer visible  
  
$$  
\ce{Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}(aq) +2HCl(aq)\to 2NaCl(aq) +SO_{2}(aq) +H_{2}O(l) +S(s)}  
$$  
- the time taken for a solution of sodium thiosulfate with dilute acid to become opaque by the precipitation of sulfur, so that a cross viewed through paper is no longer visible  
  
![sodium thiosulfate + dilute acid to sulfur precipitate.png](Media/2%20Reactivity/2.2/2%20rate/sodium%20thiosulfate%20+%20dilute%20acid%20to%20sulfur%20precipitate.png)  
##### challenge questions  
1. most gases are less soluble in warm water than in cold water, so using warm water may help to reduce a source of error when collecting a gas by displacement of water. but what new error might this create?  
  
collecting a gas over warm water will increase its temperature and thus its volume.
