Reactivity 2.1.3 - the limiting reactant determines the theoretical yield  
  
the reactant that determines the quantity of product is known as the **limiting reactant**  
  
other reactants will not be fully used, and are said to be in **excess**  
  
the **theoretical yield** refers to the maximum amount of product obtainable, assuming 100% of the limiting reactant is converted to product
