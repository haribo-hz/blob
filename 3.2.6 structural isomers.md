Structure 3.2.6 - structural isomers are molecules which have the same molecular formula but different constitutions (atom identities, connectivities, bond multiplicities)  
  
- branched, straight-chain, position, functional group isomers  
- primary, secondary, tertiary alcohols  
- halogenoalkanes  
- amines  
  
**structural isomers** have the same molecular formula but different arrangements. they have unique physical and chemical properties  
  
  
###### alkanes can have straight chain or branched structural isomers  
  
pentane's isomers

there is a trend in the boiling points of isomers: *the more branching that is present in an isomer, the lower its boiling point*  
  
this is due to the reduction of amount of surface contact between neighbouring molecules, reducing the strength of the London dispersion forces  
  
###### positional structural isomers  
alkenes and alkynes can have positional structural isomers, where the double bond is found in different positions  
  
structural isomers also occur in alcohols, halogenoalkanes and amines due to the position of their functional groups.   
  
the **primary carbon atom** is attached to the functional group and also to at least two hydrogen atoms. these molecules are known as primary molecules  
![primary molecules.png](Media/1%20Structure/1.3/2%20functional%20groups/primary%20molecules.png)  
  
a **secondary carbon atom** is attached to the functional group and to 1 hydrogen atom and 2 alkyl groups. these molecules are known as secondary molecules.  
![secondary molecules.png](Media/1%20Structure/1.3/2%20functional%20groups/secondary%20molecules.png)  
  
a **tertiary carbon atom** is attached to the functional group and also bonded to 3 alkyl groups, 0 hydrogen atoms. these molecules are known as tertiary molecules  
![tertiary molecules.png](Media/1%20Structure/1.3/2%20functional%20groups/tertiary%20molecules.png)  
  
a similar classification can also be applied to amines according to the number of alkyl groups and hydrogen atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom.

###### functional group isomers  
molecules can have the same molecular formula but different functional groups.  
  
eg $\ce{C_{2}H_{6}O}$ can describe an alcohol and an ether  
  
```smiles  
OCC  
```  
```smiles  
COC  
```  
  
###### disubstituted benzene  
disubstituted benzene is when hydrogen atoms are replaced by halogen atoms or a functional group  
  
for monosubstituted benzenes, there are no structural isomers since all six positions are identical, but 3 structural isomers are possible for disubstituted benzenes. this provides evidence for the accepted benzene model. see [1 Structure/2 models of bonding and structure/2.2 covalent model/2.2.12 benzene#evidence for the accepted structure of benzene](2.2.12%20benzene#evidence%20for%20the%20accepted%20structure%20of%20benzene.md)

##### challenge questions  
2. the subject guide only requires you to determine isomers for compounds containing up to six carbons in the longest chain. however, it can be beneficial to apply your knowledge to larger compounds. see if you can identify the nine structural isomers of heptane.  
  
no thanks!  
  
3. dimethylbenzene (xylene) has 3 structural isomers. draw and name these isomers and predict which one would have the highest melting point  
  
1,2-dimethylbenzene  
```smiles  
c1c(c)c(c)ccc1  
```  
1,3-dimethylbenzene  
```smiles  
c1c(c)cc(c)cc1  
```  
1,4-dimethylbenzene  
```smiles  
c1c(c)ccc(c)c1  
```  
  
all 3 isomers are non-polar, so the strongest intermolecular force would be London dispersion forces. to maximise strength, molecules should have a high degree of surface contact. 1,4-dimethylbenzene has the achieves the greatest surface contact out of the 3 isomers, so it has the highest melting point.
