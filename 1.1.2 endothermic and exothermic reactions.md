Reactivity 1.1.2 - reactions are described as endothermic or exothermic, depending on the direction of energy transfer between the system and the surroundings  
  
most chemical reactions are **exothermic**, give out heat to the surroundings and $\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}$ is negative.  
  
some reactions are **endothermic**, involving a heat transfer from the surroundings to the system. here, the products have more stored potential energy than the reactants, and $\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}$ is positive.
