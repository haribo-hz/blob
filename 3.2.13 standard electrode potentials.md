Reactivity 3.2.13 - standard cell potential, $E^{\ominus}_{\text{\ \ \ cell}}$ can be calculated from standard electrode potentials. $E^{\ominus}_{\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ cell}}$ has a positive value for a spontaneous reaction  
  
- the electromotive force can be calculated for a voltaic cell made from any two half-cells and deduce the direction of electron flow  
- cell potential is the difference in the tendencies of the half-cells to be reduced  
$$  
E_{\text{cell}}^{\ominus }=E^{\ominus }_{\text{reduction half-cell}}-E^{\ominus }_{\text{oxidation half-cell}}  
$$  
the $E^{\ominus}$ values used must be the reduction potentials in the data tables  
  
###### determining the direction of reaction spontaneity  
electrons move from the half-cell with the more negative electrode potential to the half-cell with the less negative electrode potential  
  
- if $E^{\ominus}_{\text{cell}}$ is positive, the reaction is spontaneous  
- if $E^{\ominus}_{\text{cell}}$ is negative, the reaction is non-spontaneous and the reverse reaction is spontaneous  
  
###### comparing relative oxidising and reducing power of half-cells  
the more negative $E^{\ominus}$, the stronger the reducing agent  
- wants to get rid of electrons  
the more positive $E^{\ominus}$, the stronger the oxidising agent  
- wants to gain electrons
