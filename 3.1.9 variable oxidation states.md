Structure 3.1.9 - the formation of variable oxidation states in transition elements can be explained by the fact that their successive ionisation energies are close in value

- all transition elements show +2 and +3 oxidation states  
- oxidation states above +3 show covalent character  
	- ions of higher charge polarise negative ions and increase covalent character
