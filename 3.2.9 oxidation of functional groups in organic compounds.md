Reactivity 3.2.9 - functional groups in organic compounds may undergo oxidation

##### oxidation of alcohols
- combustion (breaks carbon chain)
- selective oxidation of the carbon atom attached to the $\ce{-OH}$ group (keeps chain intact)

- commonly, acidified potassium dichromate(VI) is used.
- the oxidising agent is sometimes shown as $+\ \ce{[O]}$

the degree of oxidation can be related to the number of $\ce{H}$ atoms attached to the carbon with the hydroxyl group.

###### primary alcohols
- 2 $\ce{H}$ atoms attached to carbon with hydroxyl group
- can be oxidised in a two-step reaction

$$
\ce{CH_{3}CH_{2}OH \xrightarrow{\ce{+[O], heat}}CH_{3}COH\xrightarrow[reflux]{\ce{+[O], heat}}CH_{3}COOH}
$$

$$

it is possible to remove the aldehyde product by distillation. aldehydes do not have hydrogen bonding, unlike the alcohol or the acid.

the reaction mixture is heated under **reflux**, meaning the aldehyde condenses back into the reaction mixture when it evaporates.

- electric heating mantle
- vapour condenses back into the reaction vessel

###### secondary alcohols
- one $\ce{H}$ atom attached to the carbon with the hydroxyl group
- oxidised to **ketones**

$$
\ce{\underset{propan-2-ol }{ CH_{3}CHOHCH_{3} }\xrightarrow[reflux]{\ce{+[O], heat}}\underset{ \text{propanone} }{ (CH_{3})2CO } +H_{2}O}

###### tertiary alcohols
- no $\ce{H}$ atoms attached to carbon bonded to hydroxyl group
- not readily oxidised without breaking the carbon chain

##### challenge question
9. use oxidation numbers to show the differences in the extent of oxidation in the complete combustion of propane, $\ce{CH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{3}}$, and propene, $\ce{CH_{3}CHCH_{2}}$

propane: $\ce{C_{3}H_{8}}$
$\ce{C}=-\frac{8}{3},\ce{H}=+1$

propene: $\ce{C_{3}H_{6}}$
$\ce{C}=-2,\ce{H}=+1$

combustion of propane involves a bigger change of oxidation state and more oxygen is needed

10. deduce the half-equations of oxidation and reduction for oxidation of ethanol to produce ethanal with acidified potassium dichromate(VI) and state the overall reaction

oxidation:
$$
\ce{C_{2}H_{6}O\to C_{2}H_{4}O +2e- +2H+}
$$
reduction:
$$
\ce{Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-} +14H+ +6e- \to{2}Cr^{3+} + 7H_{2}O}
$$

overall:
$$
\ce{3C_{2}H_{6}O +8H+ +Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-}\to{3}C_{2}H_{4}O + 2Cr^{3+} +7H_{2}O}
$$
