Reactivity 3.1.5 - the ion product constant of water, $K_{\text{w}}$, shows an inverse relationship between $\ce{[H+]}$ and $\ce{[OH-]}$. $K_{\text{w}}=\ce{[H+][OH-]}$  
  
since most acid-base reactions involve ionisation in aqueous solution, water needs to be considered.  
  
water self-ionises very slightly at normal temperatures and pressures  
$$  
\ce{H_{2}O(l)<<=>H+(aq) +OH-(aq)}  
$$  
$$  
K=\frac{\ce{[H+][OH-]}}{\ce{[H_{2}O]}}  
$$  
  
since the concentration of water can be considered to be constant due to the fact that so little of it ionises, it can be combined with $K$ to produce a modified equilibrium constant known as $K_{\text{w}}$, the **ionic product constant of water**  
$$  
K_{\text{w}}=\ce{[H+][OH-]}  
$$  
$K_{\text{w}}$ has a fixed value at a specific temperature. at $298\pu{ K},K_{\text{w}}=1.00\times 10^{-14}$  
  
in pure water, $\ce{[H+]}=\ce{[OH-]}$, so $\ce{[H+]}=\sqrt{ K_{\text{w}} }$  
at $298\pu{ K},\ce{[H+]}=1.00\times 10^{-7}$, giving $\text{pH}=7.00$  
  
solutions can be defined as acidic, neutral, or basic according to their relative concentrations of ions  
  
$$  
\begin{align} \\  
&&&&\text{at 298 K} \\  
  
\text{acidic}&&\ce{[H+]}>\ce{[OH-]} &&\text{pH}<7\\  
\text{neutral}&&\ce{[H+]}=\ce{[OH-]} &&\text{pH}=7\\  
\text{basic}&&\ce{[H+]}<\ce{[OH-]}&&\text{pH}>7  
\end{align}  
$$  
  
if the concentration of either $\ce{H+}$ or $\ce{OH-}$ are known, the other can be calculated from the value of $K_{\text{w}}$  
  
###### $K_{\text{w}}$ is temperature dependent  
as $K_{\text{w}}$ is an equilibrium constant, its value must be temperature dependent.  
  
the reaction for the dissociation water is endothermic as it involves bond breaking, meaning that:  
- increase in temperature shifts the equilibrium to the right, increasing the value of $K_{\text{w}}$, increasing $\text{pH}$  
- decrease in temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the value of $K_{\text{w}}$, decreasing $\text{pH}$
