Reactivity 3.4.2 - in a nucleophilic substitution reaction, a nucleophile donates an electron pair to form a new bond, as another bond breaks producing a leaving group  
  
###### halogenoalkanes  
- the halogen exerts a stronger pull on the shared electrons in the carbon-halogen bond (it is more electronegative)  
- the halogen gains a partial negative charge ($\textcolor[rgb]{0.62745098, 0.83529412, 1}{\delta-}$)  
- the carbon gains a partial positive charge ($\textcolor[rgb]{0.62745098, 0.83529412, 1}{\delta+}$)  
	- is said to be **electron deficient**  
  
- nucleophiles are attracted to the electron-deficient carbon  
- this leads to **nucleophilic substitution** reactions where the halogen is substituted  
  
$$  
\ce{\underset{chloromethane}{ CH_{3}Cl } +OH-\to \underset{methanol}{ CH_{3}OH } +Cl-}  
$$  
$$  
\ce{\underset{1-bromopropane}{ C_{3}H_{7}Br } +OH- \to \underset{propan-1-ol}{ C_{3}H_{7}OH } +Br-}  
$$  
  
- the halogen atom can be substituted by a variety of nucleophiles  
- halogenoalkanes are thus very useful intermediates in organic synthesis pathways

(the substrate here is $\ce{R}$)  
the curly arrows show the movement of electron pairs  
  
- for the nucleophile to form a coordination bond to the substrate molecule, another bond must break  
- a **leaving group** breaks away from the substrate  
  
- halogens are good leaving groups as they form relatively weak bonds with carbon  
	- the weakest bond generates the best leaving group  
- the higher electronegativity means that the bonded electrons are drawn towards the halogen atom  
	- thus, the carbon atom is electron deficient and susceptible to nucleophilic attack  
  
> [!NOTE]   
the bond that forms and the bond that breaks must involve the carbon atom that is bonded to the leaving group  
  
if the nucleophile is a neutral species, the initial product formed from the substrate will be positively charged. however, this subsequently deprotonates and loses an $\ce{H+}$ to give a neutral product

if the leaving group is a halide, it could combine with the $\ce{H+}$ ion to form a hydrogen halide.
