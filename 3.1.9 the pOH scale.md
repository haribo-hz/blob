Reactivity 3.1.9 - the pOH scale describes the $\ce{[OH-]}$ concentration of a solution. $\text{pOH}=-\log_{10}\ce{[OH-]}$; $\ce{[OH-]}=10^{-\text{pOH}}$

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\text{p}K_{\text{w}}=-\log_{10}(K_{\text{w}}) \\
K_{\text{w}}=10^{-\text{p}K_{\text{w}}} \\
\text{pH}+\text{pOH}&=\text{p}K_{\text{w}} \\
\text{pH}+\text{pOH}\ \ \text{ at 298K}&=14
\end{array}
$$

> [!NOTE] 
> this relationship is true only at 298K as the ionic product of water changes with temperature.

###### strong acids and bases: $\text{pH}$ and $\text{pOH}$ can be deduced from their concentrations
as full dissociation is assumed for strong acids and bases, the ion concentrations can be calculated directly from the initial concentration. note that the $\text{pH}$ and $\text{pOH}$ are derived from the *equilibrium* concentrations of $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$
