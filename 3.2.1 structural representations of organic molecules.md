Structure 3.2.1 - organic compounds can be represented by different types of formulas. these include empirical, molecular, structural (full and condensed), stereochemical and skeletal  
  
**empirical formula** is the simplest whole-number ratio of the atoms it contains. can be derived from percentage composition data from combustion analysis  
  
**molecular formula** is the actual number of atoms of each element present in a compound  
  
**structural formula** is a representation of the molecule showing how the atoms are bonded:  
- **full structural formula** shows every bond and atom, usually with 60˚, 90˚ and 180˚ angles  
- **condensed structural formula** omits bonds where they can be assumed, and groups atoms together  
  
**stereochemical formula** shows the relative positions of atoms and groups around a central carbon in 3 dimensions

**skeletal formula** shows all bonds except $\ce{C-H}$ bonds, and omits element symbols for carbon and hydrogen atoms  
  
$\ce{C-C}$ bonds are represented as offset lines  
  
alkyls are just alkanes missing 1 hydrogen, which can be abbreviated to $\text{R}$  
  
for molecules with benzene rings, **aromatic compounds**, benzene can be shown as

##### challenge questions  
1. based on experimental evidence, the bond length of a carbon-carbon single bond is 154 pm (1 pm = $10^{-12}$m) and the radius of a carbon nucleus is $2.7\times 10^{-15}$m. if modelling kits were made to scale, how long would the plastic stick representing a single bond need to be if the carbon nucleus was represented as a plastic ball with a 0.5cm radius?  
  
$\text{ratio}=\frac{154\times{1}0^{-12}}{2.7\times{1}0^{-15}}=57000$  
the plastic stick would need to be 57000 times longer than the nucleus, so $57000 \times{0}.5=28500$
