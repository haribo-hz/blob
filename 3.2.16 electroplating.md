Reactivity 3.2.16 - electroplating involves the electrolytic coating of an object with a metallic thin layer

**electroplating** is the process of using electrolysis to deposit a layer of metal on top of another metal or conductive object

an electrolytic cell used for electroplating has the following features:
- the object to be plated (cathode)
- the electrolyte which contains the metal ions which are to coat the object
- the anode (sometimes made of the same plating metal)
	- as it is oxidised, it replenishes the ions in the electrolyte which are discharged at the cathode

- reduction of the metal ions causes their deposition on the surface of the cathode
- the process can be controlled by altering the current and the time according to how thick a layer of metal is desired

purposes:
- decorative
- corrosion control
		- **sacrificial protection**
		- **galvanised iron**
- improvement of function
	- with harder wearing materials (ie chromium)
