Reactivity 1.1.4 - the standard enthalpy change for a chemical reaction, $\Delta H^{\ominus}$, refers to the heat transferred at constant pressure under standard conditions and states. it can be determined from the change in temperature of a pure substance

$$Q=mc\Delta T$$
$$\Delta T=-\frac{Q}{n}$$

standard enthalpy change, $\Delta H^{\ominus}$ is measured under:
- pressure of 100$\text{kPa}$
- 1 $\text{mol dm}^{-3}$ for all solutions
- all substances in standard states

temperature is not part of the definition of standard state, but 298$\text{K}$ is usually given as a specified temperature

###### thermochemical equations
combustion of methane
$$
\begin{align}
&\ce{CH_{4}(g) +2O_{2}(g)\to CO_{2}(g) +2H_{2}O(l)}&\Delta H^{\ominus}_{\text{reaction}}=-890\pu{kJ mol^-1}
\end{align}
$$

shorthand of expressing that *one mole* of methane gas reacts with *two moles* of oxygen gas to give *one mole* of gaseous carbon dioxide and *two moles* of liquid water and *releases* 890$\text{kJ}$ of heat energy

###### specific heat capacity
$$Q=mc\Delta T$$

- Q is the heat added
- m is the mass of the object
- c is the specific heat capacity
- $\Delta T$ is the temperature change

###### measuring enthalpy change
a calorimeter can be used to measure the enthalpy change of combustion, $\Delta H_{\text{c}}$, of a liquid.

$$
\begin{align}
&\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}=mc\Delta T \\
&\Delta H_{c}=\frac{\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}}{\text{moles of substance used}}
\end{align}
$$

###### enthalpy changes of a reaction in solution
the enthalpy changes of a reaction in solution can be calculated by carrying out the reaction in an insulated system. the heat released or absorbed can be measured from the temperature change in the water which is acting as a solvent.

this is typically conducted in a polystyrene cup, which is an insulator

one of the largest sources of error in experiments conducted on polystyrene cups is heat loss to the surroundings:
- heat is lost as soon as the temperature rises above the temperature of the surroundings, so the maximum recorded temperature would be lower than the true value in a perfectly insulated system
- allowance for heat loss can be made by extrapolating the cooling section of the graph of temperature against time of the cup. the following assumptions can be made:

1. no heat loss from the system
2. all the heat goes from the reaction to the water
3. the solution is dilute
4. water has a density of 1.00$\pu{ g cm^{-3} }$

$$
\begin{align}
&\Delta H_{\text{system}}=0 & \text{(1)} \\
&\Delta H_{\text{system}}=\Delta H_{\text{water}}+\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}&(\text{2}) \\
&\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}=-\Delta H_{water} \\ \\

&\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}=\frac{-m(\ce{H_{2}O})\times c(\ce{H_{2}O})\times\Delta T(\ce{H_{2}O})}{n(\text{limiting reactant})} \ \pu{J mol^-1}\\ 
&\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}=\frac{-m(\ce{H_{2}O})\times c(\ce{H_{2}O})\times\Delta T(\ce{H_{2}O})}{[\text{limiting reactant}]\times V(\ce{H_{2}O})} \ \pu{J mol^-1}&\text{(3)}\\
&\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}=\frac{-c(\ce{H_{2}O})\times\Delta T(\ce{H_{2}O})}{[\text{limiting reactant}]} \ \pu{J mol^-1}&\text{(4)}\\
\end{align}
$$

for an exothermic reaction, $\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}$ is negative as heat has passed from the reaction into the water.

##### challenge questions
1. explain the particularly high specific heat capacity of water.

water has a high heat capacity as when heat energy is added to water, some of the energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds, so less energy is available to increase the kinetic energy. the presence of hydrogen bonds reduces the temperature increase and increases the specific heat capacity

2. a piece of brass is held in the flame of a Bunsen burner for several minutes. the brass is then quickly transferred into an aluminium calorimeter which contains 200.00g of water

	determine the temperature of the Bunsen flame from the follow data
