Reactivity 1.3.4 - biofuels are produced from the biological fixation of carbon over a short period of time through photosynthesis

photosynthesis is redox reactions
**chlorophyll**, the green pigment in green plants, absorbs solar energy
$$
\ce{6CO_{2}(l) +6H_{2}O(l)\to C_{6}H_{1}2O_{6}(s) +6O_{2}(g)}
$$
**biofuels** are produced from the biological fixation of carbon over a short period of time
- renewable
- sustainable energy source

photosynthesis is not very efficient, so relatively little of the available solar energy is trapped

###### biofuels
- wood is mainly cellulose, a polymer of glucose molecules
- bioethanol can be made from biomass
- methanol can be produced by heating wood in the presence of steam and limited amounts of oxygen

pros of using bioethanol:
- renewable
- produces lower emissions
- decreases dependence on oil

cons of using bioethanol:
- it absorbs water (by forming hydrogen bonds with water in the atmosphere), separating from the hydrocarbon components in the fuel and causing corrosion
$$
\ce{C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}\to 2C_{2}H_{5}OH +2CO_{2}}
$$
this fermentation process is typically done with plants high in starches and sugars, at around 37ËšC and in the absence of oxygen by yeast, which is an enzyme that catalyses the reaction

gasohol is a mixture of 10% ethanol and 90% unleaded gasoline.

##### challenge yourself
5. one part of the Earth's surface receives $1.25\times 10^{6}\pu{ J }$of solar energy. green plants such as algae absorb $1.25 \times 10^{4}\pu{ J }$of this energy.
a) determine the percentage of the sun's energy absorbed green plants
	$\frac{1.25\times 10^{4}}{1.25\times{1}0^{6}}=1\%$

b) suggest two reasons why the remainder of the Sun's energy is not absorbed by green plants.
	some wavelengths of radiation are not absorbed by chlorophyll. some radiation is reflected, some heats the surface of the Earth, plants don't cover the entire surface of the earth

6. a possible incomplete equation for the conversion of wood into hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide is:
$$
\ce{2C_{16}H_{23}O_{11} +19H_{2}O +O_{2}\to xH_{2} +yCO +zCO_{2}}
$$
a) identify the oxidation number of all the elements in the equation
	![[Media/Chem/2 Reactivity/2.1/3 fuels/challenge question 6 energy biofuels.png|800]]
b) identify the elements which are oxidised and reduced in the reaction
	$\ce{C}$ is oxidised, $\ce{H}$ and $\ce{O}$ are reduced
c) deduce the value of $x$ by balancing the changes of oxidation numbers and the number of carbon atoms
	$$
\begin{align}
y+2z&=43 \\
y+z&=32 \\
z&=11 \\
y&=21
\end{align}
$$
e) determine how many methanol molecules can be produced from one wood molecule
	$\ce{2H_{2} +CO\to CH_{3}OH}$
	$\ce{42H_{2} +21CO\to{2}1CH_{3}OH}$
	2 molecules of wood produce 21 molecules of methanol
	1 molecule of wood produces 10.5 molecules of methanol
