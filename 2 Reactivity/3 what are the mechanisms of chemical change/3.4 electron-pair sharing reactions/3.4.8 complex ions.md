Reactivity 3.4.8 - coordination bonds are formed when ligands donate an electron pair to transition element cations, forming complex ions

see [[Subjects/Chem/Notes/1 Structure/3 classification of matter/3.1 the periodic table/3.1.10 coloured complexes|3.1.10 coloured complexes]] and [[Subjects/Chem/Notes/1 Structure/3 classification of matter/3.1 the periodic table/3.1.6 oxidation states|3.1.6 oxidation states]]

###### transition metal ions act as Lewis acids and ligands as Lewis bases
- transition metals in the middle of the periodic table often form ions with vacant orbitals in their $\text{d}$ subshell
- they act as Lewis acids and accept lone pairs of electrons when they bond with ligands to form **complex ions**

since the ligand donates both electrons, a coordination bond is formed

the chemical formulas for complex ions are always written inside square brackets with the charge given at the top right
$$
\ce{Cu^{2+}(aq) +6H_{2}O(l)\to[Cu(H_{2}O)6]^{2+}(aq)}
$$

here, $\ce{Cu^{2+}}$ is a Lewis acid and $\ce{H_{2}O}$ is a Lewis base

ligands can be neutral molecules or anions but they must always contain at least one lone pair of electrons.
- neutral: $\ce{H_{2}O, NH_{3}, CO}$
- anions: $\ce{I-, Br-, Cl-, F-, OH-, SCN-, CN-}$

the charge on a complex ion depends on:
- the charge on the central transition metal ion
- the charge on the ligands
-  the coordination number

##### challenge question
1. complex ions can have stereoisomers, similar to those encountered for organic compounds. the complex ion $\ce{[Cr(NH_{3})4F_{2}]^{+}}$, included in the table, can exist as *cis-* and *trans-* isomers. see if you can deduce the difference between these two stereoisomers by drawing possible 3D structures of $\ce{[Cr(NH_{3})4F_{2}]^{+}}$
