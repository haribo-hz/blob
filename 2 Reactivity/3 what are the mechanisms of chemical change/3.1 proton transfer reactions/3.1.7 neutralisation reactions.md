Reactivity 3.1.7 - acids react with bases in neutralisation reactions

**neutralisation reactions** involve the reaction between $\ce{H+}$ ions and $\ce{OH-}$ ions to form $\ce{H_{2}O}$
$$
\ce{H+(aq) +OH-(aq)\to H_{2}O(l)}
$$
in the reaction, an ionic compound called a **salt** forms.

the **parent acid** and **parent base** form a salt.

in neutralisation reactions, for every mole of $\ce{H_{2}O}$ that forms, 2 moles of $\ce{O-H}$ bonds are formed. since bond formation is exothermic, the overall reaction is also exothermic, releasing energy.

for reactions between strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy of neutralisation, expressed per mole of $\ce{H_{2}O}$ formed, is very similar $\Delta H\approx 57\pu{kJ mol^{-1}}$


$$
\ce{Mg(s) +2HCl(aq)\to MgCL_{2}(aq) +H_{2}(g)}
$$

> [!warning] 
> when acids react with reactive metals, there is also a salt formed as the hydrogen in the acid is replaced by the metal. however, there is no proton transfer, so this is a redox reaction.

###### $\text{acid + base}\to\text{salt + water}$
eg:
$$
\ce{HNO_{3}(aq) +NH_{4}OH(aq)\to NH_{4}NO_{3}(aq) +H_{2}O(l)}
$$

note: $\ce{Ca(HCO_{3})2}$ and $\ce{LiOH}$ are soluble
###### $\text{acid + carbonate}\to\text{salt + water + carbon dioxide}$
eg:
$$
\begin{align}
\ce{
H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) +Na_{2}CO_{3}(aq)&\to Na_{2}SO_{4}(aq) +H_{2}O(l) +CO_{2}(g) \\
CH_{3}COOH(aq) +KHCO_{3}(aq)&\to KCH_{3}COO(aq) +H_{2}O(l) +CO_{2}(g)
}
\end{align}
$$

these reactions can also be represented as ionic equations
$$
\begin{align}
\ce{ 
 2H+(aq) +CO_{3}^{2-}(aq)&\to H_{2}O(l) +CO_{2}(g) \\
H+(aq) +HCO_{3}-(aq)&\to H_{2}O(l) +CO_{2}(g)
}
\end{align}
$$
bubbling is also known as **effervescence**

##### challenge questions
5. why do neutralisation reactions involving weak acids or weak bases give different values for their enthalpy of neutralisation compared with strong acids and bases?

in reactions between strong acids and bases, they are mostly ionised. however, in weak acids and weak bases, the majority of the substance is not ionised at the start of reaction, so energy is used to break bonds in ionising the reactants. the endothermic process reduces the net energy released when water forms.
