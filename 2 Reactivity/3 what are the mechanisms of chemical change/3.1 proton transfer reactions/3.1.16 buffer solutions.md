Reactivity 3.1.16 - a buffer solution is one that resists change in pH on the addition of small amounts of acid or alkali

**a buffer solution is resistant to changes in $\textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\text{pH}}$ on the addition of small amounts of acid or alkali**

- water is very vulnerable to significant fluctuations in $\text{pH}$
- biological systems are able to operate efficiently only within a narrow range of $\text{pH}$ because of the effect that $\text{pH}$ change has on enzyme action (blood)
- these systems are dependent on buffers

the ocean can absorb massive amounts of $\ce{CO2}$, but it affects lots of ocean creatures by a lot.
$$
\begin{array}{}
\ce{
CO_{2}(g) +H_{2}O(l)<=>H_{2}CO_{3}(aq) \\
H_{2}CO_{3}(aq)<=>H_{3}O+(aq) +HCO_{3}-(aq)
\\
 \\
CO_{3}^{2-}(aq) +H_{3}O(aq)<=>HCO_{3}-(aq) +H_{2}O(l)
}
\end{array}
$$
as increasing amounts of $\ce{CO_{2}(g)}$ dissolves into the ocean, it becomes carbonic acid, which dissociates into hydronium and hydrogencarbonate ions.

as the concentration of hydronium ions increases, the equilibrium shifts to the right, decreasing the concentration of carbonate ions which are needed for ocean animals

#### how buffer solutions work
- acidic buffers maintain $\text{pH}$ below 7
- basic buffers maintain $\text{pH}$ above 7

- mixture of two solutions, should be equal parts same amount of the weak substance and the salt with conjugate
	- eg 1 mol $\ce{CH_{3}COOH}$ and 1 mol $\ce{NaCH_{3}COO}$
- each contain two species of a conjugate acid-base pair
	- acidic buffer has a weak acid and a salt of a strong base
	- basic buffer has a weak base and a salt of a strong acid
- buffers can only be composed of weak acids and bases as strong acids and bases ionise completely, do not exist in equilibria in solution, and cannot carry out reversible reactions

##### acidic buffers
###### composition
- mixing aqueous solution of a weak acid with a solution of its salt of a strong alkali. for example:
$$
\ce{
\underset{ weak acid }{ CH_{3}COOH(aq) }\text{ and }\underset{ \begin{array}{}
salt of weak acid \\ with strong alkali
\end{array} }{ NaCH_{3}COO(aq) }
}
$$
these equilibria exist in this aqueous mixture:
$$
\begin{array}{}
\textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\text{(i)}} &\textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\ce{CH_{3}COOH(aq)}}\ce{<=>CH_{3}COO-(aq) +H+(aq)}\\ \\
\textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\text{(ii)}} &\ce{NaCH_{3}COO(aq)\to Na+(aq) +}\textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\ce{CH_{3}COO-(aq)}}
\end{array}
$$
(sodium ethanoate is a soluble salt, so it fully dissociates)
###### response to added acid and base
added acid $\ce{H+}$:
- following [[Subjects/Chem/notes/2 Reactivity/2 how much, how fast and how far/2.3 the extent of chemical change/2.3.4 Le Chatelier's principle|Le Chatelier's principle]], equilibrium shifts to left to remove most of the added $\ce{H+}$

added base $\ce{OH-}$:
$$
\textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\ce{CH_{3}COOH(aq)}\ }\ce{+OH-(aq)<=>CH_{3}COO-(aq) +H_{2}O(l)}
$$
this removes most of the $\ce{OH-}$

as the added $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ are used in these reactions, they do not persist in the solution and the $\text{pH}$ is largely unchanged

##### basic buffers
###### composition 
made by mixing an aqueous solution of a weak base with its salt of a strong acid for example:
$$
\begin{array}{}
\underset{ \text{weak base} }{ \ce{NH_{3}(aq)} }&\text{and}&\underset{ \begin{array}{c}
\text{salt of weak base}\\\text{with strong acid}
\end{array} }{ \ce{NH_{4}Cl(aq)} }
\end{array}
$$
these equilibria exist in this mixture of solutions:
$$
\begin{array}{}
\textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\text{(i)}}&\textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\ce{NH_{3}(aq)}\ } \ce{+H_{2}O(l)<=>NH_{4}+(aq) +OH-(aq)} \\
\textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\text{(ii)}}&\ce{NH_{4}Cl(aq)\to} \textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\ \ce{NH_{4}+(aq)}\ } \ce{+Cl-(aq)}
\end{array}

$$
the mixture contains relatively high concentrations of both $\ce{NH_{3}}$ and $\ce{NH_{4}+(aq)}$
###### response to added acid or alkali
added $\ce{H+}$:
$$
\textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\ce{NH_{3}(aq)}\ }\ce{+H+<=>NH_{4}+(aq)}
$$

added base ($\ce{OH-}$):
$$
\textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\ce{NH_{4}+(aq)}\ }+\ce{OH-(aq)<=>NH_{3}(aq) +H_{2}O(l)}
$$
the removal of added $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ by reactions with the components of the buffer solution means that they do not persist in the solution and do not alter the $\text{pH}$
