Reactivity 3.1.4 - the pH scale can be used to describe the $\ce{[H+]}$ of a solution
$$
\begin{align}
&\text{pH}=-\log_{10}\ce{[H+]} \\
&\ce{[H+]}=10^{-\text{pH}}
\end{align}
$$

since the majority of acids encountered are weak, the hydrogen ion concentration expressed directly as $\pu{ mol dm^{-3}}$ produces numbers with large negative exponents

taking the logarithm of the concentration of hydrogen ions makes expressing the concentration of an acid more user-friendly

the $\text{pH}$ scale is theoretically infinite and can extend into negative numbers, but common acids and bases will have positive $\text{pH}$ values and fall within the range of $0-14$

this corresponds to $\ce{[H+]}$ in the range $1.0\pu{ mol dm^{-3}}$ to $10^{-14}\pu{ mol dm^{-3}}$

a change of 1 $\text{pH}$ represents a 10-fold change in $\ce{[H+]}$

###### measuring pH
- universal indicator
gives a colour that can be compared with a colour chart. narrower-range indicators are more accurate. the interpretation of the colour of an indicator is always subjective, so they are useful for estimations and comparisons rather than for precision.

- pH meter
pH meters are more objective and usually more accurate method, reading the $\ce{[H+]}$ directly.

must be calibrated and standardised for the temperature

##### challenge questions
3. derive equations to show why aluminium sulfate, when added to water, gives a cloudy appearance and has a low pH.

$$
\ce{Al_{2}(SO_{4})3(s) +6H_{2}O(l)\to 2Al(OH)3(s) +3H_{2}SO_{4}(aq)}
$$

4. suggest why some gardeners water hydrangea flowers with a weak solution of vinegar

vinegar is a weak acid, so to turn hydrangea flowers blue
