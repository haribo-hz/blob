Reactivity 3.1.1 - Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor rand a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor

Reactivity 3.1.2 - a pair of species differing by a single proton is called a conjugate acid-base pair

Brønsted-Lowry theory focuses on the transfer of $\ce{H+}$ ions during an acid-base reaction:
- acids donate $\ce{H+}$ ions
- bases accept $\ce{H+}$ ions

###### conjugate acid-base pairs
in the acid-base reaction between a generic acid $\ce{HA}$ and base $\ce{B}$:
$$
\ce{HA +B<=>A- +BH+}
$$

acids react to form bases and bases react to form bases.

**conjugate acid-base pairs** differ by only 1 proton.

lots of polyatomic ions can act as Brønsted-Lowry bases by accepting $\ce{H+}$

however, the ammonium ion cannot accept $\ce{H+}$ to form a conjugate acid. it acts as an acid and forms the conjugate base $\ce{NH_{3}}$

**alkalis** are soluble bases which dissolve in water to release the hydroxide ion

##### challenge questions
1. from physical properties that you observe in the photo, what might be another way of classifying this reaction?

![[Media/Chem/2 Reactivity/2.3/1 proton transfer/nh3(g)+hcl(g).png|700]]

the product $\ce{NH_{4}Cl}$ forms smoke which is a solid, from gaseous reactants and so can be classified as sublimation or deposition
