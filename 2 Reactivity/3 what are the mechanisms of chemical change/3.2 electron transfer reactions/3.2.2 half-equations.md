Reactivity 3.2.2 - half-equations separate the processes of oxidation and reduction, showing the loss or gain of electrons

electrons are included in both half-equations to balance the charges

###### steps in acidified solutions
1. write unbalanced equations
2. assign oxidation states to determine which elements are oxidised and which are reduced
3.  write separate half-equations for oxidation and reduction including the electrons needed to account for the changes
4. balance atoms other than $\ce{H}$ and $\ce{O}$
5. balance each half-equation for $\ce{O}$ by adding $\ce{H_{2}O}$ as needed
6. balance each half-equation for $\ce{H}$ by adding $\ce{H+}$ as needed
7. check that each half-equation is balanced for atoms and for charge
8. equalise the number of electrons in the two half-equations by finding a common factor and multiplying each appropriately
9. add the two half-equations together, cancelling out anything that is the same on both sides, including electrons

##### redox titrations
titration method is the same as acid-base titrations, but the equivalence point is where the two reactants have reacted stoichiometrically by transferring electrons

###### examples
**iodine-thiosulfate reaction**
several different redox titrations use an oxidising agent to convert excess iodide ions to iodine
$$
\ce{2I-(aq) +\text{oxidising agent}\to I_{2}(aq) +\text{other products}}
$$
the liberated iodine, $\ce{I_{2}(aq)}$, is titrated with sodium thiosulfate

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{oxidation}: & \ce{2S_{2}O_{3}^{2-}(aq)\to S_{4}O_{6}^{2-}(aq) +} \textcolor[rgb]{0.72156863, 0.74117647, 0.95294118}{\ce{2e-}} \\
\text{reduction:}&\ce{I_{2}(aq) +}\textcolor[rgb]{0.72156863, 0.74117647, 0.95294118}{\ce{2e-}} \ce{\to {2}I-(aq)} \\
\text{full}:&\ce{2S_{2}O_{3}^{2-}(aq) +}\textcolor[rgb]{0.54117647,0.67843137,0.95686275}{\underset{ \begin{array}{}
\text{deep blue in} \\
\text{presence of starch}
\end{array} }{ \ce{I_{2}(aq)} }}\ce{\to 2I-(aq) +S_{4}O_{6}^{2-}(aq)}
\end{array}
$$

starch can be added as an indicator before the equivalence point is reached. it forms a blue colour by forming a complex with free $\ce{I_{2}}$. as the $\ce{I_{2}}$ is reduced to $\ce{I-}$, **the blue colour disappears, transitioning to a colourless solution**, making the equivalence point very distinct

###### analysis of iron with manganate(VII)
$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{oxidation:}&\ce{Fe^{2+}(aq)\to Fe^{3+}(aq) +e-} \\
\text{reduction:}&\textcolor[rgb]{0.72156863, 0.74117647, 0.95294118}{\ce{MnO_{4}-(aq)}}\ce{\ +8H+(aq) +\ }\textcolor[rgb]{0.72156863, 0.74117647, 0.95294118}{\ce{5e-}}\ce{\to Mn^{2+}(aq) +4H_{2}O(l)}
\end{array}
$$
$$
\text{full: }\ce{5Fe^{2+}(aq) +\ }\textcolor[rgb]{0.72156863, 0.74117647, 0.95294118}{\ce{MnO_{4}^{-}(aq)}}\ce{+ 8H+(aq) \to 5Fe^{3+}(aq) +Mn^{2+}(aq) +4H_{2}O(l)}
$$

the manganate(VII) ion is purple, while the $\ce{Mn^{2+}}$ ion is colourless, so the reaction mixture acts as its own indicator

##### challenge questions
3. reactions in which the same element is simultaneously oxidised and reduced are known as **disproportionation reactions**. deduce the equation for the reaction when $\ce{I_{2}(aq)}$ reacts with $\ce{KOH(aq)}$ to produce $\ce{KI}$, $\ce{KIO_{3}}$, and $\ce{H_{2}O}$, and show that this is a disproportionation reaction.

$$
\ce{\underset{ I=0 }{ I_{2}(aq) } +\underset{ K=+1,O= -2,H=+1 }{ KOH(aq) } \to \underset{ K=+1,I= -1 }{ KI(aq) } +\underset{ K=+1,I=+5,O= -2 }{ KIO_{3}(aq) } +\underset{ H=+1, O= -2 }{ H_{2}O }(l)}
$$

iodate ion: $\ce{IO_{3}-}$
$\ce{I}$ changes from 0 in $\ce{I_{2}}$ to -1 in $\ce{KI}$
$\ce{I}$ changes from 0 to $\ce{I_{2}}$ +5 in $\ce{KIO_{3}}$
