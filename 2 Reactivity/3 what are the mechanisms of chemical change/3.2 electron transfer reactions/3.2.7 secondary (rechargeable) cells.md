Reactivity 3.2.7 - secondary (rechargeable) cells involve redox reactions that can be reversed using electrical energy

- more expensive but becomes more economical with use
- longer life 

##### lithium ion-battery
benefits from lithium's:
- low density
- high reactivity

- stores lots of electrical energy per unit mass

- steps are taken to prevent oxide layer from forming on lithium metal (decrease in contact with electrolyte)
- lithium anode mixed with graphite
- non-aqueous polymer-based electrolyte
- lithium cathode placed in the lattice of a metal oxide

###### discharging a lithium-ion battery
at the negative electrode, lithium is oxidised:
$$
\ce{Li(polymer)\to Li^{+} +e-}
$$
at the positive electrode, the $\ce{Li+}$ ion and $\ce{MnO_{2}}$ are reduced
$$
\ce{Li+(polymer) +MnO_{2}(s) +e- \to LiMnO_{2}(s)}
$$
the half-reactions are reversed when the battery is recharged.

##### fuel cells
- since combustion reactions are redox reactions, they can be used to produce an electric current if the reactants are physically separated

###### the hydrogen fuel cell
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\ce{H_{2}(g) +\frac{1}{2}O_{2}(g)\to H_{2}O(l)}&&\Delta H_{\text{f}}^{\ominus }=-285.8\pu{ kJ mol^{-1}} \\
\ce{H_{2}(g) +\frac{1}{2}O_{2}(g)\to H_{2}O(l)}&&\Delta G^{\ominus }=-228.6\pu{ kJ mol^{-1}}
\end{array}
$$

negative electrode, anode:
$$
\ce{2H_{2}(g)\to 4H+(aq) +4e-}
$$positive electrode, cathode:
$$\ce{4H+(aq) +O_{2}(g) +4e- \to 2H_{2}O(l)}$$

##### challenge questions
5. deduce the two half-reactions that occur at the anode and cathode in the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell with aqueous sodium hydroxide as the electrolyte.

anode:
$$
\ce{H_{2}(g) +2OH-(aq)\to 2H_{2}O(l) +2e-}
$$
cathode:
$$
\ce{H_{2}O(l) +O_{2}(g) +4e- \to 4OH-(aq)}
$$

6. 
	a) show that the maximum efficiency of the hydrogen fuel cell with water as the product is about 83%.

	plug in values$$
\ce{efficiency=\frac{\Delta G_{sys}}{\Delta H_{\text{sys}}}}
$$

	b) calculate the maximum efficiency of the hydrogen cell when steam is produced instead of water.
	plug in values from equation above

	c) explain the increased efficiency of a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell which produces steam compared to water.
	
	the entropy decrease is smaller for the reaction which produces one mole of gaseous water, which leads to a larger efficiency
