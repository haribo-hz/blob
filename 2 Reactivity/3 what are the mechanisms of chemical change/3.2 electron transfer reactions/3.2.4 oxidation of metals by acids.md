Reactivity 3.2.4 - acids react with reactive metals to release hydrogen

$$
\ce{acid + metal \to salt + hydrogen gas}
$$
for example:
$$
\begin{array}{}
\ce{HCl(aq) +Zn(s)\to ZnCl_{2}(aq) +H_{2}(g) \\
H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) +Fe(s)\to FeSO_{4}(aq) +H_{2}(g) \\
2CH_{3}COOH(aq) +Mg(s)\to Mg(CH_{3}COO)2(aq) +H_{2}(g)
}
\end{array}
$$

this reaction can be thought of as the metal forcing hydrogen ions to accept electrons.

as copper does not react with dilute acids, it can be deduced that hydrogen is more reactive than copper.

the less reactive metals such as silver and gold are valuable as they are resistant to corrosion
