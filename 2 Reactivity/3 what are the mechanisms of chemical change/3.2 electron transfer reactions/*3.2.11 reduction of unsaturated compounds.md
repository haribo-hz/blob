Reactivity 3.2.11 - reduction of unsaturated compounds by the addition of hydrogen lowers the degree of unsaturation

- alkenes and alkynes contain reactive $\pi$ bonds
- this enables them to undergo **addition reactions**

alkenes react by electrophilic addition

alkenes reduced to alkanes by reacting with hydrogen:
$$
\ce{C_{n}H_{2n} +H_{2}\to C_{n}H_{2n+2}}
$$
alkynes reduced to alkenes and alkanes

\ce{H-C#C-H +H_{2}\to HC=CH} \\
\ce{H-C#C-H +2H_{2}\to (CH_{3})2}
\end{array}

##### challenge yourself
12. show that the number of hydrogen molecules needed to saturate a molecule with the molecular formula $\ce{C_{n}H_{p}O_{q}N_{r}X_{s}}$ is given by the general formula: $\text{n}_{\ce{H_{2}}}=\frac{1}{2}\times[2n+2-p-s+t]$
