Reactivity 3.2.1 - oxidation and reduction can be described in terms of electron transfer, change in oxidation state, oxygen gain/loss or hydrogen loss/gain

the term oxidation has been used for a long time to describe reactions where oxygen is involved

the term **oxidation** has been expanded to contain any reaction which involves the loss of electrons, as species generally **lose electrons** when reacting with oxygen

since the lost electrons lost cannot disappear, they are taken away by another species which is **reduced**

- oxidation is the **loss of electrons**
- reduction is the **gain of electrons**

oxidation state is the charge an atom would have if the compound were composed of ions. considering:
$$
\ce{H_{2}(g) +2Cl(g)\to 2HCl(g)}
$$
both elements have an oxidation state of 0 as the bonds in $\ce{H_{2}}$ and $\ce{Cl_{2}}$ are non-polar. the product $\ce{HCl}$ is polar with $\ce{H}$ possessing a partial charge and the $\ce{Cl}$ possessing a partial negative charge
$$
\ce{H}^\textcolor[rgb]{0.54117647,0.67843137,0.95686275}{\text{0}}\ce{-H}^{\textcolor[rgb]{0.54117647,0.67843137,0.95686275}{\text{0}}}+\ce{Cl}^{\textcolor[rgb]{0.54117647,0.67843137,0.95686275}{\text{0}}}\ce{-Cl}^{\textcolor[rgb]{0.54117647,0.67843137,0.95686275}{\text{0}}}\to \ce{2H}^{\textcolor[rgb]{0.54117647,0.67843137,0.95686275}{\delta\text{+}}}\ce{-Cl}^{\textcolor[rgb]{0.54117647,0.67843137,0.95686275}{\delta-}}
$$
given the partial charges of the molecule, $\ce{H}$ is assigned an oxidation state of $\textcolor[rgb]{0.54117647,0.67843137,0.95686275}{+1}$ and $\ce{Cl}$ an oxidation state of $\textcolor[rgb]{0.54117647,0.67843137,0.95686275}{-1}$

$\ce{H}$ is oxidised as its oxidation state has increased
$\ce{Cl}$ is reduced as its oxidation state has decreased

> [!NOTE] 
> oxidation and reduction occur during chemical change whenever there is a shift in electron density from one atom to another

it is possible for a species to be both oxidised and reduced, for example:
$$
\ce{Cl_{2}(g) +H_{2}O(l)\to HCl(aq) +HOCl(aq)}
$$

###### limitations of the oxidation concept
- oxidation states have little structural or physical significance
- the concept doesn't transfer very well to covalently bonded atoms
- in molecules with more than one atom of an element, the oxidation state is average value, can be fractional

###### oxidising and reducing agents
- the **oxidising agent**, oxidises other species, accepts electrons
- the **reducing agent**, reduces other species, supplies electrons

common examples of oxidising agents:
- $\ce{KMnO_{4}}$
- $\ce{KIO_{3}}$
- $\ce{K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}}$
- $\ce{NaOCl}$

##### challenge questions
1. assign oxidation states to the overall reactants and products of photosynthesis to show that it is a redox reaction. 

$$
\ce{\underset{ C=+2, O= -2 }{ 6CO_{2}(g) } +\underset{ H=+1, O= -2 }{ 6H_{2}O(l) }\to \underset{ C=0, H=+1, O= -2 }{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}(s) } +\underset{ O=0 }{ 6O_{2}(g) }}
$$
the oxidation state of carbon changes from $+2$ to $0$, indicating that it has been reduced

the oxidation state state of oxygen changes from $-2$ to $-2$ and $0$, indicating that it has been oxidised overall

2. hydrogen peroxide, $\ce{H_{2}O_{2}}$, can act as an oxidising agent and as a reducing agent. with reference to the oxidation states of its atoms, suggest why this is so and which behaviour is more likely.

the oxidation state of hydrogen is $+1$
the oxidation state of oxygen is $-1$

reduction of hydrogen peroxide is more likely as oxygen can be oxidised to $0$ or be reduced to $-2$. as oxygen is a very electronegative element, reduction is more likely, so it is more likely to act as an oxidising agent.
