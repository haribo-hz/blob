Reactivity 3.3.1 - a radical is a molecular entity that has an unpaired electron. radicals are highly reactive

- high enthalpy
- energetically favourable to take an electron
- short lifetimes, except in the upper atmosphere where the probability of them colliding with other chemical species is low
- unpaired electron shown by $\bullet$

different types of radicals:
- atomic
- molecular
- anionic
- cationic
