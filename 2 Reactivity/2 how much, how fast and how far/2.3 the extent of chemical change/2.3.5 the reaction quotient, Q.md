Reactivity 2.3.5 - the reaction quotient, $Q$, is calculated using the equilibrium expression with non-equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products

the **reaction quotient**, $Q$, is calculated using the same equation as the equilibrium constant expression, but with non-equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products

it is a useful concept as the size of $Q$ can indicate how far a reaction is from equilibrium and in which direction the reaction proceeds

if:
- $Q=K$, then the reaction is at equilibrium, no net reaction occurs
- $Q<K$, the reaction proceeds to the right in favour of the products
- $Q>K$, the reaction proceeds to the left in favour of the reactants
