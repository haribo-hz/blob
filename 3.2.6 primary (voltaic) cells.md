Reactivity 3.2.6 - a primary (voltaic) cell is an electrochemical cell that converts energy from spontaneous redox reactions to electrical energy  
  
![generic voltaic cell.png](Media/2%20Reactivity/2.3/2%20electron%20transfer/generic%20voltaic%20cell.png)  
  
if half-reactions occur at **spatially separated** electrodes, the electrons need to pass through an **external circuit** between the electrodes and an electric current is produced  
  
as the chemicals are not renewed during the process, it is known as a **primary cell**. a battery normally consists of several cells connected together.  
  
example of a voltaic cell:  
![voltaic cell example.png](Media/2%20Reactivity/2.3/2%20electron%20transfer/voltaic%20cell%20example.png)  
  
in a zinc half-cell, zinc atoms form ions by releasing electrons that make the surface of the metal negatively charged with respect to the solution.  
![zinc half-cell.png](Media/2%20Reactivity/2.3/2%20electron%20transfer/zinc%20half-cell.png)  
  
the electrons give the electrode a negative charge  
$$  
\ce{Zn(s)\to Zn^{2+}(aq) +2e-}  
$$  
  
the negative charge on the electrode attracts zinc ions which can gain electrons in the reverse process  
$$  
\ce{Zn(s)\leftarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) +2e-}  
$$  
at a particular charge separation, the rates of both processes will be the same and equilibrium is reached:  
$$  
\ce{Zn(s)<=>Zn^{2+}(aq) +2e-}  
$$  
  
the position of this equilibrium depends on the reactivity of the metal:  
- the more reactive, the more towards ions  
- the less reactive, the more towards solid metal  
  
as copper is a less reactive metal, the equilibrium position favours the formation of metal.  
$$  
\ce{Cu(s)<=>Cu^{2+}(aq) +2e-}  
$$  
  
the copper metal strip will have fewer electrons and be less negative than the zinc metal strip.  
  
when the two half-cells are connected by an external wire and a salt bridge, electrons will have a tendency to flow spontaneously through the external circuit from the more negative zinc half-cell to the less negative copper half-cell.  
  
the tendency for electrons to flow can be quantified by measuring the potential difference between the two electrodes with a volt meter.

the anode is negative as the reaction goes towards electrons  
  
the cathode is positive as the reaction goes from electrons to neutral metal  
  
external electronic circuit:  
- required for electron flow  
  
salt bridge:  
- glass tube / strip of absorptive paper with aqueous ions  
- movement of ions neutralises build up of charge and potential difference  
- anions move from cathode to anode  
- anions move in opposite direction to electrons  
- cations move from anode to cathode  
- solutions chosen should not interfere with reactions at electrodes  
  
###### cell diagram convention  
**cell diagram**  
- | single vertical line represents a phase boundary  
- || double vertical line represents salt bridge  
- aqueous solutions of each electrode are placed next to the salt bridge  
- anode on left, cathode on right  
- electron flow is from left to right  
- spectator ions omitted  
- half-cells with two ions separate ions with comma (in same phase)  
  
eg  
$$  
\ce{Zn(s)|Zn^{2+}(aq)||Cu^{2+}(aq)|Cu(s)}  
$$  
  
the cell diagram is set out to show the direction of the two half reactions  
  
$$  
\begin{align}  
&\ce{Zn(s)|Zn^{2+}(aq):Zn(s)\to Zn^{2+}(aq) +2e-} \\  
&\ce{Cu^{2+}(aq)|Cu(s):Cu^{2+}(aq) +2e^{-}\to Cu(s)}  
\end{align}  
$$  
###### different half-cells make voltaic cells with different voltages  
the voltage generated between half-cells is determined by the *difference* in reducing strength of the two metals. this can be judged by the relative position of the metals in the activity series.
