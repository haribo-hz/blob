Reactivity 3.4.8 - coordination bonds are formed when ligands donate an electron pair to transition element cations, forming complex ions  
  
see [1 Structure/3 classification of matter/3.1 the periodic table/3.1.10 coloured complexes](/1%20Structure/3%20classification%20of%20matter/3.1%20the%20periodic%20table/3.1.10%20coloured%20complexes.md) and [1 Structure/3 classification of matter/3.1 the periodic table/3.1.6 oxidation states](/1%20Structure/3%20classification%20of%20matter/3.1%20the%20periodic%20table/3.1.6%20oxidation%20states.md)  
  
###### transition metal ions act as Lewis acids and ligands as Lewis bases  
- transition metals in the middle of the periodic table often form ions with vacant orbitals in their $\text{d}$ subshell  
- they act as Lewis acids and accept lone pairs of electrons when they bond with ligands to form **complex ions**  
  
since the ligand donates both electrons, a coordination bond is formed

the chemical formulas for complex ions are always written inside square brackets with the charge given at the top right  
$$  
\ce{Cu^{2+}(aq) +6H_{2}O(l)\to[Cu(H_{2}O)6]^{2+}(aq)}  
$$

here, $\ce{Cu^{2+}}$ is a Lewis acid and $\ce{H_{2}O}$ is a Lewis base  
  
ligands can be neutral molecules or anions but they must always contain at least one lone pair of electrons.  
- neutral: $\ce{H_{2}O, NH_{3}, CO}$  
- anions: $\ce{I-, Br-, Cl-, F-, OH-, SCN-, CN-}$  
  
![complex ion shapes.png](Media/2%20Reactivity/2.3/4%20electron%20pair%20sharing/complex%20ion%20shapes.png)  
the charge on a complex ion depends on:  
- the charge on the central transition metal ion  
- the charge on the ligands  
-  the coordination number  
  
##### challenge question  
1. complex ions can have stereoisomers, similar to those encountered for organic compounds. the complex ion $\ce{[Cr(NH_{3})4F_{2}]^{+}}$, included in the table, can exist as *cis-* and *trans-* isomers. see if you can deduce the difference between these two stereoisomers by drawing possible 3D structures of $\ce{[Cr(NH_{3})4F_{2}]^{+}}$
