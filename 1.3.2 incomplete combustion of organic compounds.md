Reactivity 1.3.2 - incomplete combustion of organic compounds, especially hydrocarbons, leads to the production of carbon monoxide and carbon

happens when:
- supply of air is limited
- when the compound has a high percentage of carbon content

for example:

$$
\begin{align}
\ce{2C_{3}H_{8}(g) +2O_{2}(g)&\to 6CO(g) +8H_{2}O(g)} \\
\ce{C_{3}H_{8}(g) +2O_{2}(g)&\to 3C(g) + 4H_{2}O(g)}
\end{align}
$$

compounds with higher carbon content generally undergo more incomplete combustion and produce more soot when the oxygen supply is limited. this can be used to distinguish different organic compounds

incomplete combustion releases less heat than complete combustion. this is why the enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide is more exothermic than that of carbon monoxide or soot.

catalytic converters are used in cars to fully oxidise carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and to convert unburnt ant partially burnt fuel hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water. 3-way catalytic converters also reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen.

$$
\begin{align}
&\ce{2CO(g) +O_{2}(g)\to 2CO_{2}(g)} \\
&\ce{2CO(g) + 2NO(g)\to 2CO_{2}(g) +N_{2}(g)}
\end{align}
$$

##### challenge questions
2. explain how nitrogen oxides are formed in an internal combustion engine and suggest an effect of these pollutants.

in the high temperatures of internal combustion engines, nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere combine to form nitrogen oxides
$$
\ce{N_{2}(g) + O_{2}(g)\to 2NO(g)}
$$
