Reactivity 1.1.1 - chemical reactions involve a transfer of energy between the system and the surroundings, while total energy is conserved

**energy** is a measure of the ability to do **work**, to move an object against an opposing force. heat is a form of energy transfer that occurs as a result of a temperature difference, a process of energy transfer. temperature, rather, is a measure of the *average* kinetic energy of the particles, which is a property of the system.

the **system** is the area of interest, and the **surroundings** is the rest of the universe

an **open system** allows energy and matter to be exchanged with the surroundings

in a **closed system**, energy can be exchanged with the surroundings, but the matter cannot. the total energy does not change during the process, however.

an **isolated system** cannot exchange matter or energy with the surroundings

the chemical potential energy of a system is called **enthalpy**. when heat is added to a system from the surroundings, the enthalpy of the system increases. when the system gives out heat, its enthalpy decreases. changes in enthalpy are denoted by $\Delta H$.
