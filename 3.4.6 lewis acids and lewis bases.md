Reactivity 3.4.6 - a Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor and a Lewis base is an electron-pair donor

Reactivity 3.4.7 - when a Lewis base reacts with a Lewis acid, a coordination bond is formed. nucleophiles are Lewis bases and electrophiles are Lewis acids.

the reaction in which ammonia acts as a base can be represented as:
![[Media/Chem/2 Reactivity/2.3/4 electron pair sharing/ammonia as a lewis base.png]]

$\ce{H+}$ is acting as an electron-pair acceptor, and the nitrogen atom is ammonia is acting as an electron-pair donor.

- a acid is a lone pair acceptor
- a Lewis base is a lone pair donor

thus, Lewis bases and Brønsted-Lowry bases are therefore the same group of compounds:
- by either definition, they are species that must have a lone pair of electrons

for Lewis acids, the Lewis definition is broader:
- it is any species capable of accepting a lone pair of electrons
- all Brønsted-Lowry acids are Lewis acids (since $\ce{H+}$ has a vacant orbital)
- it also includes molecules that have an incomplete valence shell

Lewis acid-base reactions result in the formation of a covalent bond, which will always be a coordination bond as both electrons come from the base

for example: $\ce{BF_{3}}$
![[Media/Chem/2 Reactivity/2.3/4 electron pair sharing/trifluoroborate as a lewis base.png]]
- $\ce{BF_{3}}$ has an incomplete octet, so it can act as a Lewis acid and accept a pair of electrons
- $\ce{NH_{3}}$ acts as a Lewis base, donating its lone pair of electrons

###### Lewis acids are electrophiles and Lewis bases are nucleophiles
- a nucleophile is electron-rich, and donates a lone pair in bond formation
this is consistent with the definition of Lewis bases

- an electrophile is electron-deficient, and accepts a lone pair in bond formation
this is consistent with the definition of Lewis acids
