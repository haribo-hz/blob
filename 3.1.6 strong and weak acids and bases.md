Reactivity 3.1.6 - strong and weak acids and bases differ in the extent of ionisation  
  
- the **position of equilibrium** for the dissociation of an acid or a base defines its strength  
	- if the acid or base dissociates fully, its equilibrium lies to the right and is said to be a **strong** acid or base  
	- if the acid or base dissociates only partially, its equilibrium lies to the left and is said to be a **weak** acid or base  
##### dissociation reactions  
###### dissociation of acids  
  
dissociation of a strong acid example  
$$  
\ce{  
\underset{ strong acid }{ HCl(aq) }+\underset{ base }{ H_{2}O(l) }\to \underset{ conjugate acid^{ } }{ H_{3}O+(aq) }+\underset{ conjugate base }{ Cl-(aq) }  
}  
$$  
- since $\ce{HCl}$ dissociates fully, the reverse reaction can be considered to be negligible, so the reaction is written without the equilibrium sign  
  
dissociation of a weak acid example  
$$  
\ce{  
\underset{ weak acid }{ CH_{3}COOH(aq) }+\underset{ conjugate base }{ H_{2}O(l) }<=>\underset{ conjugate acid }{ H_{3}O+(aq) }+\underset{ conjugate base }{ CH_{3}COO^-(aq })  
}  
$$  
- since $\ce{CH_{3}COOH}$ dissociates partially, it is written with an equilibrium sign  
  
==**acid dissociation reactions favour the production of the weaker conjugate**==  
###### dissociation of bases  
strong base dissociation example:  
$$  
\ce{NaOH(aq)\to Na+(aq) +OH-(aq)}  
$$  
- since $\ce{NaOH}$ dissociates fully, its dissociation is written without equilibrium signs  
  
weak base dissociation example:  
$$  
\ce{NH_{3}(aq) +H_{2}O(l)<=>NH_{4}+(aq) +OH-(aq)}  
$$  
- since $\ce{NH_{3}}$ is a weak base as it ionises only partially, its equilibrium lies to the left and the concentration of ions is low  
  
**==base dissociation reactions favour the production of the weaker conjugate==**  
  
##### acids and bases to remember  
  
strong:  
  
| acids              | bases       |  
| ------------------ | ----------- |  
| $\ce{HCl}$         | $\ce{LiOH}$ |  
| $\ce{HBr}$         | $\ce{NaOH}$ |  
| $\ce{HI}$          | $\ce{KOH}$  |  
| $\ce{HNO_{3}}$     |             |  
| $\ce{H_{2}SO_{4}}$ |             |  
  
weak:  
  
| acids              | bases         |  
| ------------------ | ------------- |  
| organic acids      | $\ce{NH_{3}}$ |  
| $\ce{H_{2}CO_{3}}$ | amines        |  
| $\ce{H_{3}PO_{4}}$ |               |  
  
the strength of a Br√∏nsted-Lowry acid depends on the ease with which it dissociates - which depends on the strength of the bond.  
  
weaker bonds and longer bonds require less energy to break, so as an example: the acid strength of hydrogen halides increases down the group $\ce{HF<HCl<HBr<HI}$  
  
##### distinguishing between strong and weak acids and bases  
due to the greater ionisation in solution, strong acid sand bases will contain a higher concentration of ions than weak acids and weak bases. this can then be used to distinguish between them  
###### electrical conductivity  
- the electrical conductivity of a solution depends on the concentration of mobile ions  
- strong acids and bases will show higher conductivity than weak acids and bases  
(given the concentrations of solutions compared are equal)  
###### rate of reaction  
the reactions of acids with bases depend on the concentration of $\ce{H+}$ ions, so stronger acids will react faster  
###### $\text{pH}$  
as it is a measure of the concentration of $\ce{H+}$, the $\text{pH}$ scale can be used to directly compare the strengths of acids given that they are of equal concentration
