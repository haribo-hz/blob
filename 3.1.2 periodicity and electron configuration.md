Structure 3.1.2 - the period number shows the outer energy level that is occupied by electrons

elements in a group have a common number of valence electrons

group 1: **alkali metals**
group 2: **alkali earth metals**
group 15: **pnictogens**
group 16: **chalcogens**
group 17: **halogens**
group 18: **noble gases**

the period of an element gives the number of occupied energy levels
