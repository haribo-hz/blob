Reactivity 3.4.12 - the relative stability of carbocations in the addition reactions between hydrogen halides and unsymmetrical alkenes can be used to explain the reaction mechanism

###### addition reactions of unsymmetrical alkenes follow Markovnikov's rule
**Markovnikov's rule:**

- the hydrogen will attach to the carbon that is already bonded to the greater number of hydrogens
- the more electropositive part of the reacting species bonds to the least highly substituted carbon atom in the alkene


- the addition of an unsymmetrical alkene has two potential products but only one is formed exclusively
looking at the addition reaction of $\ce{C_{3}H_{6}}$ with $\ce{HBr}$, the specificity of this reaction can be explained

in the first step, the $\pi$ bond is attracted to the electrophile and can open in 2 ways, resulting 2 carbocation intermediates
- (a) a primary carbocation
- (b) a secondary carbocation

the **secondary carbocation** is more stable as:
- there are 2 positive inductive effects from the 2 alkyl groups around it compared to the **primary carbocation**
- the positive inductive effect pushes electron density away from the alkyl groups and towards the carbocation, lessening the density of the positive charge

thus, it is the more stable carbocation and more likely to persist and react with $\ce{Br-}$

so then, 2-bromopropane will be the main product of the reaction

thus, the correct mechanism for the reaction is:
