| addition     | - occurs when two reactants combine to form a single product<br>- characteristic of unsaturated compounds<br>- $\ce{C_{2}H_{4} +Br_{2}\to C_{2}H_{4}Br}$                                                      |  
| substitution | - occurs when one atom or group of atoms in a compound is replaced by a different atom or group<br>- characteristic of saturated compounds and aromatic compounds<br>- $\ce{CH_{4} +Cl_{2}\to CH_{3}Cl +HCl}$ |  
  
###### types of bond-breaking (bond fission)

| - is when a covalent bond breaks by splitting the shared pair of electrons between thet wo products | - is when a covalent bond breaks with both the shared electrons going to one of the products |  
| - produces two radicals, each with an unpaired electron                                             | - produces two oppositely charged ions                                                       |

###### convention for depicting organic reaction mechanisms  
- a curly arrow shows movement of movement electrons within bonds and between reactants  
	- drawn from site of electron availability  
![curly arrow convention.png](Media/2%20Reactivity/2.3/4%20electron%20pair%20sharing/curly%20arrow%20convention.png)  
- a double-barbed arrow represents the motion of an electron pair  
  
- a single-barbed arrow, known as a **fish hook**, represents the movement of a single electron  
	- often used in reactions involving radicals
