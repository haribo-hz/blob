Reactivity 3.1.8 - pH curves for neutralisation reactions involve strong acids and bases have characteristic shapes and features  
  
###### generation from a titration  
**acid-base titration** is a quantitative technique.  
  
the reaction between an acid and a base takes place in the flask until the **equivalence point** or **stoichiometric point** is reached, when the acid and base are present in ratio where both are exactly neutralised.  
  
plotting the $\text{pH}$ against the volume of titrant added, a non-linear curve is produced (if using a $\text{pH}$ meter continuously)  
  
a big jump in $\text{pH}$ is found in most titrations at equivalence, known as the **point of inflection**. the equivalence point is determined as being halfway up the jump  
  
the equivalence point can also be determined using an acid-base indicator  
  
###### $\text{pH}$ curve of strong acid and strong base  
- full dissociation is assumed  
- as the titrant is added, neutralisation occurs while excess titrand remains  
- as **volume changes during addition**, this must be taken into account in determining the concentration
