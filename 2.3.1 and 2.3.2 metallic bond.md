Structure 2.3.1 - a metallic bond is the electrostatic attraction between a lattice of cations and delocalised electrons  
  
Structure 2.3.2 - the strength of a metallic bond depends on the charge of the ions and the radius of the metal ion  
  
**metallic character** refers to how easily elements lose their valence electrons  
  
in the elemental state, valence electrons are loosely held by the metal atoms' nuclei, so they become **delocalised** and spread themselves evenly throughout the **cation lattice**. (cations now because the atoms have lost their valence electrons)  
  
properties and explanation:

the strength of a metallic bond is determined by:  
- the number of delocalised electrons  
- the charge of the cation  
- the radius of the cation  
  
left to right across a period:  
- increasing melting point (from more delocalised electrons)  
- greater attraction between ions and delocalised electrons (from greater cation charge)  
- lower reactivity (from lower bond strength)  
  
down a group:  
- decreasing melting point (from greater cation radius)  
- weaker attraction between ions and delocalised electrons (from greater cation radius, more distance means weaker)  
- higher reactivity (from greater cation radius, from weaker attraction)
