Structure 1.1.1 - elements are the primary constituents of matter, which cannot be chemically broken down into simpler substances.  
  
compounds consist of atoms of different elements chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio  
  
mixtures contain more than one element or compound in no fixed ratio, which are not chemically bonded and so can be separated by physical methods  
  
##### elements:  
- primary constituents of matter, cannot be broken down into simpler substances  
- denoted by chemical symbol  
- defined by the number of protons in the nucleus  
##### compounds:  
- atoms consisting of different elements chemically bonded in a **fixed ratio**  
- denoted by chemical formula  
##### mixtures:  
- consist of more than one element or compound in no fixed ratio, **not chemically bonded**  
- can be separated through physical methods  
	solvation, filtration, recrystallisation, evaporation, distillation, chromatography  
  
homogenous:  
- uniform composition and properties  
- the inter-particle attraction within the different components must be similar in nature to those between the components in the mixture  
  
e.g. air, metal alloys[1 Structure/2 models of bonding and structure/2.3 metallic model/2.3.1 and 2.3.2 metallic bond](2.3.1%20and%202.3.2%20metallic%20bond.md), dissolved salts  
  
heterogenous:  
- non-uniform composition, properties  
- interaction between components are different in nature  
- i.e. water (hydrogen bonding) and oil (dispersion forces)  
  
###### separating mixtures  
if components in a mixture have distinct difference in a physical property, they can be separated easily  
  
technique chosen will depend upon this property  
  
solubility → solvation, filtration, recrystallisation  
boiling point → distillation/evaporation  
magnetism → magnet  
polarity/adsorption → chromatography  
  
filtration:  
- filtrate: what goes through  
- residue: what's left on the membrane  
  
(fractional) distillation:  
- when solvent and solute have different boiling points  
  
[1 Structure/2 models of bonding and structure/2.2 covalent model/2.2.10 imf and chromatography](2.2.10%20imf%20and%20chromatography.md):  
- difference in polarity → adsorption/desorption  
  
##### challenge questions:  
1. If you add $10\text{cm}^3$ of water to $10\text{cm}^3$ of water, you get $20\text{cm}^3$ of water. Similarly, if you add $10\text{cm}^3$ of ethanol to $10\text{cm}^3$ of ethanol, you get $20\text{cm}^3$ of ethanol. Explain why the volume of solution formed between $10\text{cm}^3$ of water and $10\text{cm}^3$ of ethanol is less than $20\text{cm}^3$.  
  
The molecules of ethanol can partly fit between the spaces between the water molecules and vice versa.  
  
2. Does a mixture have the same classification at all scales?  
  
A mixture may appear homogenous when observed with the naked eye, but may be heterogenous under a microscope. The classification depends on the scale on which the components are analysed.
