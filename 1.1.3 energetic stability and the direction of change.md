Reactivity 1.1.3 - the relative stability of reactants and products determines whether reactions are endothermic or exothermic

there is a natural direction for change, in the direction of lower stored, or potential energy. reactions can be expected to occur if it leads to a reduction in potential energy, increased stability.

limitations:
stability is a relative term, and hydrogen peroxide is stable with respect to its constituent elements, but unstable relative to its decomposition to water and oxygen.

sometimes endothermic reactions do occur spontaneously. 

using enthalpy change as a guide to change does not indicate the rate of reaction

some reactions do not occur at a noticeable rate as the reactants need to be given some energy to react. the minimum kinetic energy to react is known as the **activation energy, $E_{\text{a}}$**. this energy is needed as some bonds in the reactants must be broken before new bonds in the products can form.
