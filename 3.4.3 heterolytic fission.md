Reactivity 3.4.3 - heterolytic fission is the breakage of a covalent bond when both bonding electrons remain with one of the two fragments formed

- nucleophilic substitution reactions involve **heterolytic fission**
	- one of the products gains both the shared electrons
	- the more electronegative atom will gain the negative charge

- the reverse process occurs when a nucleophile donates a pair of electrons to an electrophile
