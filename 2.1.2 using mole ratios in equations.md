Reactivity 2.1.2 - the mole ratio of an equation can be used to determine:  
- the masses and/or volumes of reactants and products  
- the concentrations of reactants and products for reactions occurring in solution  
  
chemical equation is an expression of reactants combining in a fixed ratio to form products. the most convenient way to express this ratio is as moles.  
  
the mole ratio of an equation can be used to determine the volumes of gaseous reactants and products.  
$$  
\ce{V\propto n}  
$$  
where $V$ is volume and $n$ is the number of moles  
  
all gases under the same conditions have the same **molar volume**, $V_{\text{m}}$, according to [1 Structure/1 models of particulate nature of matter/1.4 the mole/1.4.6 avogadro's law](/1%20Structure/1%20models%20of%20particulate%20nature%20of%20matter/1.4%20the%20mole/1.4.6%20avogadro's%20law.md)  
  
at STP, 0ËšC, 100$\pu{ kPa}$, one mole of gas has a volume of $2.27\times 10^{-2}\pu{ m^{3} mol^{-1} }$or $22.7\pu{ dm^{3} mol^{-1}}$  
  
$$  
\text{number of moles of gas}(n)=\frac{\text{volume}(V)}{\text{molar volume}(V_{\text{m}})}  
$$

the mole ratio of an equation can be used to determine the concentrations of reactants and products in solutions  
  
can be used in volumetric analysis and titrations  
  
###### back titrations  
back titration is done in reverse by returning to the end point after it is passed. back titration is used when the end point is hard to identify or when one of the reactants is impure.  
  
a known excess of one of the reactants is added to the reaction mixture, and the unreacted excess is then determined by titration against a standard solution. by subtracting the amount of unreacted reactant from the original amount used, the reacting amount can be determined.  
  
##### challenge yourself  
1. the combustion of both ammonia, $\ce{NH_{3}}$, and hydrazine, $\ce{N_{2}H_{4}}$, in oxygen gives nitrogen and water only. when a mixture of ammonia and hydrazine is burnt in pure oxygen, the volumetric $\ce{N_{2}}:\ce{H_{2}O}$ ratio in the product gas is $0.40$. calculate the % by mass of ammonia in the original mixture. what assumptions are being made here?  
  
52% $\ce{NH_{3}}$ by mass, gases behave as ideal gases, no side reactions occur
