Reactivity 3.3.3 - radicals take part in substitution reactions with alkanes, producing a mixture of products  
  
###### halogenation occur via a radical mechanism  
- alkanes contain strong $\ce{C-C}$ and $\ce{C-H}$ bonds which take a lot of energy to break  
- alkanes are non-polar, so do not attract nucleophiles or electrophiles  
- so are relatively unreactive compounds  
- are regarded as **kinetically stable** due to high activation energies  
  
however, they are **thermodynamically unstable** compared to the products  
  
##### radical substitution reactions occur in 3 stages  
- alkanes are saturated, so they mainly undergo substitution  
eg  
$$  
\ce{CH_{4}(g) +Cl_{2}(g)\xrightarrow{\text{UV light}}CH_{3}Cl(g) +HCl(g)}  
$$  
  
once formed, the radicals will start a **chain reaction** where a mixture of products including the halogenoalkane is formed  
  
###### initiation   
- formation of radical species  
- eg photolytic fission of chlorine  
$$  
\ce{Cl_{2}\xrightarrow{\text{UV light}}2Cl\bullet }  
$$  
###### propagation  
- the radicals formed in initiation react with other species forming new radicals  
- many possible propagation steps allowing the reaction to continue  
  
for example:  
$$  
\begin{array}{}  
\ce{  
 Cl\bullet +CH_{4}\to CH_{3}\bullet +HCl \\  
CH_{3}\bullet +Cl_{2}\to CH_{3}Cl +Cl\bullet  \\  
CH_{3}Cl +Cl\bullet \to CH_{2}Cl\bullet +HCl \\  
CH_{2}Cl\bullet +Cl_{2}\to CH_{2}Cl_{2} +Cl\bullet   
}  
\end{array}  
$$  
  
###### termination  
- remove radicals from the mixture when they react with each other  
- pair up their electrons to form a covalent bond  
  
for example:  
$$  
\begin{array}{}  
\ce{  
Cl\bullet +Cl\bullet \to Cl_{2} \\  
CH_{3}\bullet +Cl\bullet \to CH_{3}Cl \\  
CH_{3}\bullet +CH_{3}\bullet \to C_{2}H_{6} \\  
CH_{2}Cl\bullet +Cl\bullet \to CH_{2}Cl_{2}  
}  
\end{array}  
$$  
  
the reaction mixture may contain mono- and disubstituted halogenoalkanes, as well as $\ce{HCl}$ and larger alkanes
