Reactivity 3.4.9 - nucleophilic substitution reactions include the reactions between halogenoalkanes and nucleophiles  
  
Reactivity 3.4.10 - the rate of the substitution reactions is influenced by the identity of the leaving group

- $S_\text{N}$ - **s**ubstitution **n**ucleophilic, is used to describe the reactions of nucleophiles with primary and tertiary halogenoalkanes  
- the exact mechanism of these reactions depends on whether the halogenoalkane is primary, secondary, or tertiary  
  
##### mechanism  
  
###### primary halogenoalkanes react via $\textcolor[rgb]{0.72156863, 0.74117647, 0.95294118}{S_\text{N}2}$  
- primary halogenoalkanes have at least 2 hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon of the $\ce{C-X}$ bond. for example:  
```smiles  
[H]C([H])([H])C([H])([H])Cl  
```  
  
the overall reaction that occurs with $\ce{NaOH}$ is:  
$$  
\ce{C_{2}H_{5}}\textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\ce{Cl}}\ \ce{+}\ \textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\ce{OH-}}\to \ce{C_{2}H_{5}}\textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\ce{OH}} \ \ce{+}\ \textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\ce{Cl-}}  
$$  
  
- as the hydrogen atoms are so small, the carbon atom is relatively open to attack by the nucleophile  
- an unstable **transition state** is formed in which the carbon is weakly bonded to both the halogen and the nucleophile  
  
![sn2 reaction mechanism unstable transition state.png](Media/2%20Reactivity/2.3/4%20electron%20pair%20sharing/sn2%20reaction%20mechanism%20unstable%20transition%20state.png)  
  
- this is a one-step concerted reaction with an unstable transition state  
	- concerted means that the bonds break and form at the same time  
- since the mechanism is dependent on the concentration of *both* of $\ce{RX}$ *and* $\ce{OH-}$, it is a **bimolecular** reaction, and will be second order overall  
  
therefore, this mechanism is fully described as $\boldsymbol{S_\text{N}2}$: **s**ubstitution **n**ucleophilic $\textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\boldsymbol{ 2 }}^{\text{nd}}$ order  
  
the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon atom on the *opposite side* from the leaving group, which causes an **inversion** of the arrangement of the atoms around the carbon atom.  
  
![inversion of arrangement of atoms with nucleophilic attack.png](Media/2%20Reactivity/2.3/4%20electron%20pair%20sharing/inversion%20of%20arrangement%20of%20atoms%20with%20nucleophilic%20attack.png)  
  
these configurations are a result of different spatial arrangements around tetrahedrally bonded carbon atoms.  
  
the $S_\text{N}2$ mechanism is **stereospecific** because the 3D arrangement of the reactants determines the 3D configuration of the products  
  
- bond formation comes before bond cleavage in the transition state, so the stereochemistry of the carbon attacked is not lost  
- optically active reactants will react via $S_\text{N}2$ to give optically active products.  
  
###### tertiary halogenoalkanes react via $S_\text{N}1$  
  
- tertiary halogenoalkanes have 3 alkyl groups attached to the carbon of the $\ce{C-X}$ bond. eg:  
```smiles  
CC(C)(C)Cl  
```  
$$  
\underset{\text{2-chloro-2-methylpropane}}{ \ce{(CH_{3})C}\textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\ce{Cl}} }\ + \ \textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\ce{OH-}}\to \underset{\text{2-methylpropan-2-ol}}{ \ce{(CH_{3})3C}\textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\ce{OH}} }\ +\ \textcolor[rgb]{0.92941176,0.49019608,0.58823529}{\ce{Cl-}}  
$$  
- here, the presence of three alkyl groups around the carbon of the $\ce{C-X}$ bond causes what is called **steric hindrance**  
- the presence of the bulky groups makes it difficult for an incoming group to attack the carbon atom  
  
- the first step of an $\ce{S_\text{N}}1$ reaction involves heterolytic fission of the $\ce{C-X}$ bond and the halide ion leaving  
- this creates a **carbocation intermediate** with a positive charge centred on the carbon  
- this intermediate is then attacked by the nucleophilic $\ce{Cl-}$ in the second step of the reaction, leading to the formation of a new bond  
  
- the carbocation intermediate has a planar shape, which means the nucleophile can attack from any position in the second step  
- thus, the $S_\text{N}1$ reaction is **not stereospecific**, and optically active reactants react via $S_\text{N}1$ to give products that are **racemic** mixtures  
  
- this mechanism is favoured in tertiary halogenoalkanes as the carbocation is stabilised by the three alkyl groups  
- the three alkyl groups have a **positive inductive effect**, meaning that they are electron donating  
- this allows the carbocation to persist long enough for the second step to occur  
  
the blue arrows on the bonds show this positive inductive effect  
  
![sn1 reaction mechanism steps.png](Media/2%20Reactivity/2.3/4%20electron%20pair%20sharing/sn1%20reaction%20mechanism%20steps.png)  
  
since the rate-determining step is only determined by the concentration of the $\ce{RX}$, it is described as a **unimolecular reaction** and will be first order overall  
- $\text{rate}=k\ce{[halogenoalkane]}$  
- therefore, this mechanism is fully described as $\boldsymbol{S_\text{N}1}$: **s**ubstitution **n**ucleophilic $\textcolor[rgb]{0.65098039,0.85490196,0.58431373}{\boldsymbol{ 1 }}^{\text{st}}$ order  
  
  
  
###### secondary halogenoalkanes  
it is not possible to be precise about the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in secondary halogenoalkanes, as data shows that they usually undergo a mixture of both $S_\text{N}1$ and $S_\text{N}2$ mechanisms  
  
##### rate:  
###### the influence of the leaving group  
experimental data shows that the rate of nucleophilic reactions for halogenoalkanes with the same carbon chain length and branching, follows the order:  
$$  
\text{iodoalkanes > bromoalkanes > chloroalkanes > fluoroalkanes}  
$$  
- this is consistent with the bond enthalpies of $\ce{C-X}$ bonds  
- the weaker the bond, the easier it is to break and the better the halide ion is as a leaving group  
  
best to worst:  
$$  
\ce{I- > Br- > Cl- > F-}  
$$  
  
###### $\textcolor[rgb]{0.72156863, 0.74117647, 0.95294118}{S_\text{N}1}$ mechanism rate expression  
- the $S_\text{N}1$ mechanism is favoured by tertiary halogenoalkanes and is a two-step mechanism  
- the rate depends on the slow first step and it is first order with the rate only depending on the concentration of the halogenoalkane:  
$$  
\text{rate}=k\ce{[halogenoalkane]}  
$$  
- since there are two steps, it proceeds from reactants to products via an intermediate, which is shown as a local minimum in the reaction profile  
  
- because the $S_\text{N}1$ mechanism involves 2 steps, the reaction profile has 2 activation energies and each step proceeds through independent transition states  
  
###### $\textcolor[rgb]{0.72156863, 0.74117647, 0.95294118}{S_\text{N}2}$ mechanism rate expression  
  
- the $S_\text{N}2$ mechanism is favoured by primary halogenoalkanes and occurs through a concerted one-step mechanism  
- it is a second order reaction with the rate depending on the concentrations of both the halogenoalkane and nucleophile:  
$$  
\text{rate}=k\ce{[halogenoalkane][nucleophile]}  
$$  
- since there is only 1 step, it proceeds from reactants to products via a single transition state
