Reactivity 3.4.1 - a nucleophile is a reactant that forms a bond to its reaction partner (the electrophile) by donating both bonding electrons  
  
**nucleophiles**:  
- are a reactant that forms a covalent bond to its reaction partner (the electrophile) by donating both bonding electrons  
- are typically electron rich  
	- have one or more lone pairs of electrons  
	- may carry a negative charge  
eg:  
- neutral: $\ce{H_{2}O, NH_{3}, ROH, RNH_{2}}$  
- anions: $\ce{OH-,F-,Cl-,Br-,I-,CN-, R-}$  
  
the covalent bond formed is a coordination bond

neutral molecules can be nucleophiles as they contain electron-rich areas that result from **instantaneous dipoles** or **permanent dipoles**
