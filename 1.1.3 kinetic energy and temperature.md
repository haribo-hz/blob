Structure 1.1.3 - temperature in kelvin is a measure of average kinetic energy ($E_{\text{k}}$)of particles  
  
  
absolute temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles  
  
0K = -273.15ËšC (absolute 0)  
- this is the lowest temperature attainable, as this is when all movement stops

a-b  
	as the solid is heated, vibrational energy increases, temperature increases.  
b-c  
	the vibrations are energetic enough for particles to move away from fixed positions and form a liquid. the temperature remains constant as the energy is used to break inter-particle forces.  
c-d  
	as the liquid is heated, vibrational energy increases, temperature increases.  
d-e  
	this is the boiling point. there is enough energy to break all inter-particle forces and form a gas.   
	note that this state change requires more energy than solid-liquid as all inter-particle forces must be broken.  
	temperature remains constant as energy is used to break inter-particle forces  
e-f  
	as the gas is heated under pressure, the kinetic energy of its particles rise, so the temperature continues to rise too  
  
melting (b-c) and boiling (d-e) are endothermic processes as energy is taken from the environment  
  
freezing (c-b) and condensation (e-d) are exothermic processes as energy is given to the environment as inter-particle forces bring the particles closer together

##### challenge questions  
5. Which physical properties determine the gradient of the lines for the different states in figure 5?  
  
$$  
\begin{eqnarray}  
\Delta E &&= mc \Delta T \\  
\text{Gradient} &&= \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta E} \\  
&&= \frac{\Delta T}{mc\Delta T} \\  
&&= \frac{1}{mc}  
\end{eqnarray}  
$$  
  
the mass and specific heat capacity determines the gradient of the lines.
