Structure 1.1.3 - temperature in kelvin is a measure of average kinetic energy ($E_{\text{k}}$)of particles


absolute temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles

0K = -273.15ËšC (absolute 0)
- this is the lowest temperature attainable, as this is when all movement stops

a-b
	as the solid is heated, vibrational energy increases, temperature increases.
b-c
	the vibrations are energetic enough for particles to move away from fixed positions and form a liquid. the temperature remains constant as the energy is used to break inter-particle forces.
c-d
	as the liquid is heated, vibrational energy increases, temperature increases.
d-e
	this is the boiling point. there is enough energy to break all inter-particle forces and form a gas. 
	note that this state change requires more energy than solid-liquid as all inter-particle forces must be broken.
	temperature remains constant as energy is used to break inter-particle forces
e-f
	as the gas is heated under pressure, the kinetic energy of its particles rise, so the temperature continues to rise too

melting (b-c) and boiling (d-e) are endothermic processes as energy is taken from the environment

freezing (c-b) and condensation (e-d) are exothermic processes as energy is given to the environment as inter-particle forces bring the particles closer together

##### challenge questions
5. Which physical properties determine the gradient of the lines for the different states in figure 5?

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta E &&= mc \Delta T \\
\text{Gradient} &&= \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta E} \\
&&= \frac{\Delta T}{mc\Delta T} \\
&&= \frac{1}{mc}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

the mass and specific heat capacity determines the gradient of the lines.
