Structure 2.2.11 - resonance structures occur when there is more than one possible position for a double bond in a molecule  
  
in some molecules, bonding electrons are not confined to one location, but rather show a tendency to be shared between more than one bonding position - **delocalisation**  
  
the delocalised electrons spread themselves out, giving greater stability to the molecule or ion.  
  
e.g.: ozone, $\ce{O_{3}}$  
![ozone resonance structures.png](Media/1%20Structure/1.2/2%20covalent/ozone%20resonance%20structures.png)  
  
these structures suggest that the molecule should contain 1 double bond and 1 single bond, which would have differing bond strengths and lengths. however, experimental data shows that ozone contains two equal oxygen-oxygen bonds, intermediate in length and strength between single and double bonds.  
  
thus, the true structure of ozone would be a combination, or a **resonance hybrid** of the two structures shown above. this is shown as

note: resonance structures do not represent forms that flip from one to the other.   
  
also, resonance can be used to explain why $\ce{O_{2}}$ molecules, require shorter wavelength light to dissociate compared to molecules of $\ce{O_{3}}$. (double bond vs 1.5ish bond)

note: lone pairs of electrons are not shown on the structure of a resonance hybrid as they are involved in the process of delocalisation so do not have a fixed position.
