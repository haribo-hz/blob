Reactivity 2.1.1 - chemical equations show ther atio of reactants and products in a reaction  
  
left hand side has **reactants**  
right hand side has **products**  
  
according to the law of conservation of matter, atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction  
  
the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation. this is known as **balancing the equation**, using numbers called **stoichiometric coefficients**
