Structure 2.4.6 - condensation polymers form by the reaction between functional groups in each monomer with the release of a small molecule  
  
```smiles  
[A][H].[B]O[H]>>[A][B].[H]O[H]  
```  
  
monomers with *2 functional groups* can be used to make condensation polymers, which can be thought of as "active ends" where condensation reactions can occur.  
  
###### carboxylic acid + alcohol → polyester  
when a monomer has two $\ce{-COOH}$ groups and the other monomer has two $\ce{-OH}$ groups, an **ester link** forms. the chain extends in both directions and is known as a **polyester**.

###### carboxylic acid + amine → polyamide  
when a monomer has two $\ce{-COOH}$ groups and the other monomer has two $\ce{-NH_{2}}$ groups, an **amide link** forms. the chain extends in both directions and is known as a **polyamide**.

###### hydrolysis  
all biological macromolecules are condensation polymers synthesised in cells by condensation reactions  
  
starch is produced by linking glucose into long chains.  
  
the reverse reaction is known as **hydrolysis**  
  
hydrolysis reactions occur during digestion, decomposition, and when stored materials need to be mobilised. condensation and hydrolysis reactions are controlled by **enzymes** (biological catalysts)
