Structure 2.4.6 - condensation polymers form by the reaction between functional groups in each monomer with the release of a small molecule

```smiles
[A][H].[B]O[H]>>[A][B].[H]O[H]
```

monomers with *2 functional groups* can be used to make condensation polymers, which can be thought of as "active ends" where condensation reactions can occur.

###### carboxylic acid + alcohol → polyester
when a monomer has two $\ce{-COOH}$ groups and the other monomer has two $\ce{-OH}$ groups, an **ester link** forms. the chain extends in both directions and is known as a **polyester**.

###### carboxylic acid + amine → polyamide
when a monomer has two $\ce{-COOH}$ groups and the other monomer has two $\ce{-NH_{2}}$ groups, an **amide link** forms. the chain extends in both directions and is known as a **polyamide**.

###### hydrolysis
all biological macromolecules are condensation polymers synthesised in cells by condensation reactions

starch is produced by linking glucose into long chains.

the reverse reaction is known as **hydrolysis**

hydrolysis reactions occur during digestion, decomposition, and when stored materials need to be mobilised. condensation and hydrolysis reactions are controlled by **enzymes** (biological catalysts)
