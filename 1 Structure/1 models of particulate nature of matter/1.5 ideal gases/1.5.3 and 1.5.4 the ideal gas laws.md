Structure 1.5.3 - the molar volume of an ideal gas is constant at a specific temperature and pressure

Structure 1.5.4 - the relationship between the pressure, volume, temperature and amount of an ideal gas is shown in the ideal gas equation $PV=nRT$ and the combined gas law

$$\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{n_{1}T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{n_{2}T_{2}}$$

proportionality/inverse proportionality can be figured out by looking at $PV=nRT$

$a\propto b$ means $a$ is proportional to $b$
$a \propto \frac{1}{b}$ means $a$ is inversely proportional to $b$

##### molar volume

according to avogadro's law, the volume occupied by one mole of any gas is the same since the particles in a gas have negligible volume compared with the volume the gas occupies.

number of moles of gas ($n$) = $\frac{\text{volume } (V)}{\text{molar volume}}$

##### ideal gas equation
the gas equation and avogadro's law can be combined to give $\frac{PV}{T}\propto n$

this can be made into an equation by introducing a constant, $R$. this is known as the **universal gas constant** as it does not depend on the identity of the gas.

$\therefore \frac{PV}{T}=nr\implies PV=nRT$

$R=8.31\pu{ J K^{-1} mol^{-1} }$

##### real gases
an ideal gas is defined as one that obeys the ideal gas law under all conditions. this means that for one mole of gas, $\frac{PV}{RT}=1$. however, as an ideal gas doesn't exist. thus, for real gases $PVâ‰ nRT$ at all conditions.

this graph lets us draw some conclusions, that:
- gases behave most like an ideal gas at low pressure and shows the greatest deviation at high pressure
- gases behave most like an ideal gas at high temperature and shows the greatest deviation at low temperature

1. if the volume of the gas particles is not negligible, $\frac{PV}{nRT}>1$
2. there are attractive forces between the particles, $\frac{PV}{nRT}<1$

**van der Waal's equation** takes into account the measure of attraction between the particles (a) and the volume excluded by the particles (b)

$\left( P+\frac{n^{2}a}{V^{2}} \right)(V-nb)=nRT$ 

##### challenge questions
2. Consider a sample of gas at pressure $P_1$, volume $V_1$, and temperature $T_1$ (K) which is expanded to a new volume $V_2$ at constant temperature $T_1$ with a new pressure $P_0$
a) state the relationship between $P_1$, $V_1$, $P_0$ and $V_2$ for expansion at constant temperature $T_1$

$PV$ is constant

b) the gas is then heated at constant volume $V_2$ to new conditions $P_2$, $V_2$, and $T_2$. state the relationship between $P_0$, $T_1$, $P_2$, and $T_2$ when the gas is heated at constant volume $V_2$.

$\frac{P}{T}$ is constant

c) deduce a relationship between the initial conditions and the final conditions.

derive combined gas equation from substitution in a)

3. Blowing up a balloon increases its volume as the number of particles increases. What do you think would happen to this inflated balloon at the top of a very high mountain?

at the top of a very high mountain, the pressure would be lesser than that of lower altitudes, so the volume would increase.

4. a) calculate the volume of $18.0\text{g}$ of steam at a temperature of $500\text{K}$ and a pressure of $1.00 \times 10^{5}\text{Pa}$ and show that the volume occupied by the particles is negligible.

$$
\begin{align}
PV&=nRT\\
V&=\frac{nRT}{P}\\
&=\frac{\frac{18}{2\times 1 + 16}\times 8.31\times 500}{1.00\times 10^{5}} \\
&=0.0416\pu{ m^{-3} }
\end{align}
$$
consider the volume that 18g of water in its liquid form occupies, 18cm$^3$

% volume occupied by water molecules = $\frac{18}{41600}=0.0433\%$

b) show that the volume occupied by the particles is not negligible when the pressure is increased to $5.00\times 10^{7}\text{Pa}$ and the temperature is reduced to $400\text{K}$

$$
\begin{align}
PV&=nRT\\
V&=\frac{nRT}{P}\\
&=\frac{\frac{18}{2\times 1 + 16}\times 8.31\times 400}{5.00\times 10^{7}} \\
&=66.48\pu{ cm^{-3} }
\end{align}
$$
% volume occupied by water molecules = $\frac{18}{66.48}=27.1\%$

5. show that the van der Waal's equation correctly predicts values of $\frac{PV}{RT}>1$ for 1 mol of gas at very high pressures

at high pressures, $P+\frac{a}{V^{2}}\approx P$ since $\frac{a}{V^{2}}$ is very small compared to very big P.

hence,
$$
\begin{align}
\left( P+\frac{n^{2}a}{V^{2}} \right)(V-nb)&=nRT \\
PV-Pb&=RT \\
\frac{PV}{RT}&=1+\frac{Pb}{RT}
\end{align}
$$

6. show that the van der Waal's equation correctly predicts values of $\frac{PV}{RT}<1$ for 1 mol of gas at very low pressures

at low pressures, $V-nb\approx V$ since b is negligible because the particles are so spread out

hence,
$$
\begin{align}
\left( P+\frac{n^{2}a}{V^{2}} \right)(V-nb)&=nRT \\
PV+\frac{a}{V}&=RT \\
\frac{PV}{RT}&=1-\frac{a}{VRT}
\end{align}
$$
