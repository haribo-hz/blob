Structure 2.4.5 - addition polymers form by the breaking of a double bond in each monomer

addition reactions occur when a multiple bond in a molecule breaks and forms new bonding positions. alkenes and alkynes readily undergo addition reactions, so they can form **addition polymers**

polychloroethene or poly vinyl chloride and polytetrafluoroethene

$$
\text{\% atom economy}=\frac{\text{molar mass of desired product}}{\text{molar mass of all reactants}}
$$

addition polymerisation reactions do not generate a by-product and so convert 100% of reactants into product. a reaction yield of less than 100% means there is unreacted monomer at the end of the process. 


> [!NOTE] 
lots of polymerisation reactions also use solvents and conditions of high temperature, pressure and/or catalysts, which must be taken into account as part of an environmental assessment of the process


##### challenge question
2. draw the repeating unit in polystyrene, given that the formula of the monomer is $\ce{C_{6}H_{5}CHCH_{2}}$
