Structure 2.4.1 - bonding is best described as a continuum between the ionic, covalent and metallic models, and can be represented by a bonding triangle

describing a substance as purely one of the three models is inaccurate, as most materials are an intermediate between ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding types

the position of a substance on the bonding triangle can help to predict its properties

$\chi$ is the symbol for electronegativity

the x-axis is the average electronegativity of bonded elements
the y-axis is the electronegativity difference of bonded elements
