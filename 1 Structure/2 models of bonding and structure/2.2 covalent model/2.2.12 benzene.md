Structure 2.2.12 - benzene, $\ce{C_{6}H_{6}}$, is an important example of a molecule that has resonance

- 6 carbon atoms in a hexagonal ring
- triangular planar arrangement with 120Ëš bond angles

the circle in the middle represents delocalised electrons, which are spread equally through the ring

###### evidence for the accepted structure of benzene
benzene's structure can be explained through a combination of physical and chemical properties
