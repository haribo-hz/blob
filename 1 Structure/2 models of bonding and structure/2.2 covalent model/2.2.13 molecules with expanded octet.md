Structure 2.2.13 - some atoms can form molecules in which they have an expanded octet of electrons

when the central atom is an element from period 3 or further down, there exist compounds with more than eight electrons around the central atom - an **expanded octet**

- due to d orbitals in valence shell having close energy values to p orbitals
promotion of electrons from 3p to 3d can allow additional electron pairs


###### five electron domains
determining the shape:
1. find arrangement with lowest number of lone pair to lone pair 90˚ angles
2. find arrangement with lowest number of 90˚ angles between lone pairs and bonding pairs
3. prefer lowest number of LP-LP 90˚


0 non-bonding pairs: **triangular bipyramidal**

1 non-bonding pair: **unsymmetrical tetrahedron** or **see-saw**

$\ce{SF_{4}}$

distortion from greater repulsion of non-bonding electrons

2 non-bonding pairs: **T-shaped**
$\ce{ClF_{3}}$

bond angles less than 90˚

electrons located in equatorial position to minimise repulsion

3 non-bonding pairs: **linear**

##### challenge yourself
7. the position of bonding and non-bonding pairs of electrons in molecules or ions with five electron domains can be predicted by identifying the arrangement with the lowest number of lone pair-lone pair 90˚ angles followed by the lowest number of 90˚ angles between lone pairs and bonding pairs.

	can you use this approach to show why we observe see-saw, T-shaped, and linear geometries for $\ce{SF_{4}}$, $\ce{ClF_{3}}$, and $\ce{I_{3}^{-}}$ seen in this section?
