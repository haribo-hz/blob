Structure 3.1.8 - transition elements have incomplete $d$-sublevels that give them characteristic properties

change in atomic radii across $\text{d}$ block is due to small increase in $\text{Z}_{\text{eff}}$

the change in nuclear charge is **offset** by the addition of the addition of an electron in the inner $3\text{d}$ sublevel

zinc is not a transition metal as it does not have multiple oxidation states, only +2, does not form coloured complexes. the $\text{d}$ sublevel is complete in both species

###### physical properties
- high electrical and thermal conductivity
- high melting point
- malleable
- high tensile strength
- ductile
- ferromagnetic 3 (iron, cobalt, nickel)

###### ferromagnetism
magnetic properties due to presence of unpaired electrons in $\text{d}$ orbitals. spinning electrons behaves as a magnet. when aligned, lead to magnetic properties

###### chemical properties
- form compounds with >1 oxidation state
- form a variety of complex ions
- form coloured complexes
- act as catalysts

###### as catalysts
provides alternate reaction pathways with lower activation energy

i.e. iron in Haber process:
$$\ce{N_{2}(g) +3H_{2}(g)<=> 2NH_{3}(g)}$$
