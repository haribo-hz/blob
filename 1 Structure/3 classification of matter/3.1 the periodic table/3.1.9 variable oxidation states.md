Structure 3.1.9 - the formation of variable oxidation states in transition elements can be explained by the fact that their successive ionisation energies are close in value

![[Media/Chem/1 Structure/1.3/1 periodic table/1st row d block oxidation states.png|800]]

- all transition elements show +2 and +3 oxidation states
- oxidation states above +3 show covalent character
	- ions of higher charge polarise negative ions and increase covalent character
