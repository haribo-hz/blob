Structure 3.2.3 - a homologous series is a family of compounds in which successive members differ by a common structural unit, typically $\ce{CH_{2}}$. each homologous series can be described by a general formula

alkanes, alkynes, halogenoalkanes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, ethers, amines, amides and esters

3.2.4 - successive members of a homologous series show a trend in physical properties

###### homologous series differ by a $\ce{CH_{2}}$ group

organic compounds are classified into 'families' of compounds, known as **homologous series**. the members possess certain common features

the molecular mass increases by a fixed amount moving up a homologous series

###### members of a homologous series can be represented by the same general formula
eg:
- alkanes: $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n+2}}$
- alcohols $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n+1}OH}$

###### members of a homologous series show a trend in physical properties
as successive members of a homologous series differ by a $\ce{-CH_{2}-}$ group, they have successively longer carbon chains. this is reflected in a gradual trend in the physical properties:
- melting point/boiling point
- density
- viscosity

longer chains means stronger London dispersion forces

###### functional groups affect the physical properties of organic compounds
functional groups have a significant effect on physical properties
