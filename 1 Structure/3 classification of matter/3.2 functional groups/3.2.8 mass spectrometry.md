Structure 3.2.8 - mass spectrometry of organic compounds can cause fragmentation of molecules

the mass spectrometer can be used to find the mass of individual atoms and the relative abundance of isotopes, as well as the relative molecular mass of compounds.

###### fragmentation patterns
$$
\ce{\underset{molecule}{X(g)}+e- \to \underset{molecular ion}{X+(g)}+2e-}
$$
the ionisation process in the mass spectrometer involves an electron hitting the incident species and removing an electron. in some cases, the collision can be so energetic that it causes the molecule to break up into different fragments.

for each fragmentation, one of the products keeps the positive charge, so two outcomes are possible for each bond broken.

generally, the fragment that gives the most stable ion is formed and subsequently observed in the mass spectrum.
