Reactivity 2.2.12 - the Arrhenius equation uses the temperature dependence of the rate constant to determine the activation energy  
  
Reactivity 2.2.13 - the Arrhenius factor, $A$, takes into account the frequency of collisions with proper orientations  
#### the Arrhenius equation is used to determine the activation energy of a reaction  
##### $k$ is temperature dependent  
  
the rate of reaction depends on two things:  
- the rate constant, $k$  
- the concentrations of reactants raised to a power  
  
since increasing temperature doesn't change the concentration, its effect must be on the value of $k$  
  
collision theory explains the effect of increasing temperature:  
- more collisions that involve particles having the activation energy  
- a greater proportion of collisions leading to reaction  
  
Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution curves can be used to show the changing distribution of kinetic energies with increasing temperature  
  
- when the activation energy is large, a temperature rise will cause a significant increase in the number of particles  
- when the activation energy is small, a temperature rise will cause a smaller effect on the reaction rate

##### the temperature dependence of rate constant is expressed in the Arrhenius equation  
Svante Arrhenius showed that the fraction of molecules with energy greater than the activation energy is proportional to $e^{\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$  
  
this can be written as  
$$k\propto e^{\frac{-E_{\text{a}}}{RT}}\text{ or } k=Ae^{\frac{-E_{\text{a}}}{RT}}  
$$  
where $A$ is the **Arrhenius factor**, also called the **frequency factor** or **pre-exponential factor**  
- $A$ takes into account the frequency with which successful collisions will occur based on collision geometry  
- constant for a reaction  
- has the same units as $k$ (and varies depending on the order of the reaction)  
  
##### calculation with the Arrhenius equation  
###### the equation of a straight line  
  
taking the natural logarithm of the Arrhenius equation:  
$$  
\ln k=-\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{RT}+\ln A  
$$  
this is in the form of $y=mx+c$  
  
the **Arrhenius plot** is the graph of $\ln k$ on the y-axis against $\frac{1}{T}$ on the x-axis will give a straight line with gradient $-\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{R}$.

###### solving simultaneous equations  
activation energy can also be calculated from values of $k$ at two temperatures.  
  
at temperature $T_{1}$, the rate constant is:  
$$  
\ln k_{1}=-\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{RT_{1}}+\ln A\tag{1}  
$$  
at temperature $T_{2}$, the rate constant is:  
$$  
\ln k_{2}=-\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{RT_{2}}+\ln A\tag{2}  
$$  
subtracting the second from the first:  
$$  
\begin{array}  
\center(2)-(1)\\  
\ln \frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{R}\left( \frac{1}{T_{2}}-\frac{1}{T_{1}} \right)  
\end{array}  
$$
