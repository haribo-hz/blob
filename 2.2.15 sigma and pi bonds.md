Structure 2.2.15 sigma bonds ($\sigma$) form by the head-on combination of atomic orbitals where the electron density is concentrated along the bond axis  
  
pi bonds ($\pi$) form by the lateral combination of p-orbitals where the electron density is concentrated on opposite sides of the bond axis  
  
a bond can be thought of as when two atomic orbitals, each containing one electron, combine to form a new **molecular orbital** that is at a lower energy level

the **bond axis** is an imaginary line between two nuclei  
  
###### the sigma ($\sigma$) bond  
when two atomic orbitals combine **head-on** along the **bond-axis**, the bond is described as a **sigma bond**. electron density is concentrated **between the nuclei** of the bonded atoms.  
  
this bond forms by the overlap of   
- s orbitals  
- p orbitals  
- hybrid orbitals

sigma bonds are stronger as the shared electron density is located closer to the two nuclei, resulting in a greater force of electrostatic attraction  
###### the pi ($\pi$) bond  
when two p orbitals combine **laterally**, the electron density of the molecular orbital is concentrated in two regions, above and below the plane of the bond axis.  
  
pi bonds are weaker than sigma bonds as the **electron density** is further away from the positive charge of the nucleus, so they break more easily during chemical reactions
