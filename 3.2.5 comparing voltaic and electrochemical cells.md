Reactivity 3.2.5 - oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode in electrochemical cells  
  
voltaic and electrolytic cells are collectively known as electrochemical cells.  
- voltaic (galvanic) cells generate electricity from chemical reactions  
	- a **spontaneous chemical reaction** drives electrons around a circuit  
- electrolytic cells drive chemical reactions using electrical energy  
	- an electric current reverses the normal directions of chemical change, **non-spontaneous reactions occur**  
  
|                        | voltaic     | electrolytic    |  
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |  
| type of reaction       | spontaneous | non-spontaneous |  
| electrode of oxidation | anode       | anode           |  
| electrode of reduction | cathode     | cathode         |  
| polarity of anode      | negative    | positive        |  
| polarity of cathode    | positive    | negative        |  
  
they are the reverse of each other  
- a voltaic cell converts chemical energy to electrical energy  
- an electrolytic cell converts electrical energy to chemical energy when an electric current drives a reaction with a negative value for $E$ from the equilibrium
