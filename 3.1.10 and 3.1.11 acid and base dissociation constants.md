Reactivity 3.1.10 - the strengths of weak acids and bases are described by their $K_\text{a}$, $K_{\text{b}}$, $pK_{\text{a}}$, or $pK_{\text{b}}$ values  
  
Reactivity 3.1.11 - for a conjugate acid-base pair, the relationship $K_{\text{a}}\times K_{\text{b}}=K_{\text{w}}$ can be derived from the expressions for $K_{\text{a}}$ and $K_{\text{b}}$  
  
- weak acids and bases do not dissociate fully, so the concentration of ions cannot be deduced from the initial concentrations  
- the ion concentrations rather depend on the extent of dissociation

considering the generic weak acid $\ce{HA}$ dissociating in water:  
$$  
\begin{array}{\center}  
\ce{HA(aq) +H_{2}O(l)<=>H_{3}O_{(aq)} +A-(aq)} \\  
K=\ce{\frac{[H_{3}O+][A-]}{[HA][H_{2}O]}} \\  
K_{\text{a}}=\ce{\frac{[H_{3}O+][A-]}{[HA]}}  
\end{array}  
$$  
(given that the concentration of water is a constant)  
  
- $K_{\text{a}}$ is known as the **acid dissociation constant**  
- it will have a fixed value for a particular acid at a specific temperature  
- it is also known as the **acid ionisation constant**  
  
as the value of $K_{\text{a}}$ depends on the position of the equilibrium of acid dissociation, it gives a direct measure of the strength of an acid.  
  
the higher the value of $K_{\text{a}}$ at a particular temperature, the greater the dissociation, the stronger the acid  
  
since $K_{\text{a}}$ is an equilibrium constant, its value does not depend on the concentration of the acid or on the presence of other ions  
  
considering the dissociation of a generic base $\ce{B}$ in water  
$$  
\begin{array}{center}  
\ce{  
B(aq) +H_{2}O(l)<=>BH+(aq) +OH-(aq)  
} \\  
K=\ce{\frac{[BH+][OH-]}{[B][H_{2}O]}} \\  
K_{\text{b}}=\ce{\frac{[BH+][OH-]}{[B]}}  
\end{array}  
$$  
- $K_{\text{b}}$ is known as the **base dissociation constant**  
- it will have a fixed value for a particular base at a specified temperature  
  
same principles apply to $K_{\text{b}}$ as $K_{\text{a}}$  
  
###### calculations involving $K_{\text{a}}$ and $K_{\text{b}}$  
the values of $K_{\text{a}}$ and $K_{\text{b}}$ allows for the comparison of strength of weak acids and bases  
  
> [!NOTE]   
> - the given concentration of an acid or base is its *initial* concentration  
> - the $\text{pH}$ or $\text{pOH}$ of a solution refers to the concentration of $\ce{H+}$ ions or $\ce{OH-}$ ions at *equilibrium*  
> - when the extent of dissociation is very small, it is appropriate to use the approximations:  
> $$  
> \begin{align}  
\ce{[acid]_{\text{initial}}&\approx[acid]_{\text{equilibrium}}} \\

###### $\text{p}K_{\text{a}}$ and $\text{p}K_{\text{b}}$ are logarithmic expressions of $K_{\text{a}}$ and $K_{\text{b}}$  
directly using $K_{\text{a}}$ and $K_{\text{b}}$ is a bit clumsy as there are negative exponents and span a wide range of values  
  
$$  
\begin{array}{l}  
\text{p}K_{\text{a}}=-\log_{10}K_{\text{a}}&&\text{p}K_{\text{b}}=-\log_{10}K_{\text{b}} \\  
K_{\text{a}}=10^{-\text{p}K_{\text{a}}}&&K_{\text{b}}=10^{-\text{p}K_{\text{b}}}  
\end{array}  
$$  
  
###### the relationship between $K_{\text{a}}$ and $K_{\text{b}}$ is reciprocal for a conjugate acid-base pair  
  
for a conjugate acid-base pair $\ce{HA/A-}$:  
$$  
\begin{array}{l}  
\ce{  
HA(aq)<=>H+(aq) +A-(aq)}&&K_{\text{a}}=\ce{\frac{[H+][A-]}{[HA]}} \\  
\ce{A-(aq) +H_{2}O(l)<=>HA(aq) +OH-(aq)}&&K_{\text{b}}=\ce{\frac{[HA][OH-]}{[A-]}}  
\end{array}  
$$  
$$  
\begin{array}{center}  
K_{\text{a}}\cdot K_{\text{b}}=\ce{\frac{[H+]\cancel{ \ce{[A]} }}{\cancel{ [\ce{HA}] }}}\cdot \ce{\frac{\cancel{ [\ce{HA}] }[OH-]}{\cancel{ \ce{[A-]} }}} \\  
K_{\text{a}}\cdot K_{\text{b}}=\ce{[H+]\cdot[OH-]}=K_{\text{w}} \\  
\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{p}K_{\text{b}}=\text{p}K_{\text{w}}  
\end{array}  
$$  
$$  
\begin{array}{}  
\text{at 298}\pu{ K,}&K_{\text{w}}=1.00\times 10^{-14} \text{ so }\text{p}K_{\text{w}}=14.00 \\  
\therefore&\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{p}K_{b}=14.00\text{ at 298}\pu{ K}  
\end{array}  
$$  
  
this shows the inverse relationship between the strength of acids and their conjugate bases.  
- the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base  
- the stronger the base, the weaker the conjugate acid  
  
##### challenge questions  
6. increasing the length of the carbon chain *decreases* the acid strength of the $\ce{-COOH}$ group but *increases* the basic strength of the $\ce{-NH_{2}}$ group. can you suggest why this is so? hint: think about the electron density distributions in the molecules  
  
increasing the length of the carbon chain causes less electron withdrawal from the $\ce{O-H}$ bond as electrons are pushed towards the carbonyl $\ce{C}$ atom  
  
the basic strength of amines depends largely on the availability of the lone pair electrons on nitrogen. longer carbon chains push electrons towards $\ce{N}$ more than shorter carbon chains, so longer carbon chains are stronger
