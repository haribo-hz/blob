Reactivity 2.1.4 - the percentage yield is calculated from the ratio of experimental yield to theoretical yield  
  
theoretical yield is usually different from **experimental yield**  
  
reasons why experimental yield might be lower than theoretical yield:  
- incomplete reaction  
- side reactions occurring  
- the decomposition of reactants / products  
- loss of product during purification  
- reversible chemical reactions prevention process completion  
  
reasons why experimental yield might be higher than theoretical yield:  
- incomplete reaction  
- impurities  
- product not fully dried  
  
$$  
\text{percentage yield}=\frac{\text{experimental yield}}{\text{theoretical yield}}
