Structure 1.3.6 - In an emission spectrum, the limit of convergence at a higher frequency responds to ionisation

the first ionisation energy of an element is the energy needed to remove one mole of electrons from the ground state of one mole of the gaseous atom

once removed, the electron is an infinite distance away from the nucleus and can be considered to be in the $n=\infty$ energy level.

the frequency at which convergence occurs can be obtained graphically. this can then be used to calculate the ionisation energies of atoms.

this is an example with the hydrogen atom:
the frequencies of the lines where the transitions involve the electron falling from the excited levels with $n\geq 1\text{ to the }n=1$ energy level are shown below. the difference between the frequencies in successive lines is given in the third column.

| excited energy level ($n$) | frequency: $f/\times10^{-14}s^{-1}$ | difference in frequency:<br>$\Delta f/\times 10^{-14}s^{-1}$ |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

a graph of $f$ against $\Delta f\text{ or }f_{n+1}-f_{n}$ is shown below
![[Media/Chem/1 Structure/1.1/3 electron configuration/approximation for frequency for ionisation of hydrogen atom.png|800]]

the line of best fit provides an approximate best-fit straight line with the intercept on the x-axis giving the frequency at which convergence occurs.

convergence occurs when $\Delta f=0$ at $f=32.3\times 10^{-14}\pu{ s^{-1} }$
using the equation $E=hf$ we have the ionisation energy for one atom:
$$E=32.3 \times 10^{-14}s^{-1} \times 6.63 \times 10^{-34}\pu{ J s^{-1} }$$
thus, for one mole, the first ionisation of hydrogen is given by:
$$\begin{align}
\text{IE}&=32.3 \times 10^{-14}\text{s}^{-1}\times 6.63 \times 10^{-34}\pu{ J s }\times 6.02 \times 10^{23}\pu{ mol^{-1} } \\
&=1290\pu{ kJ mol^{-1} }
\end{align}$$
this is pretty close to the value of $1312\pu{ kJ mol^{-1} }$ given in the data booklet.

##### successive ionisation energy data for an element gives information about its electron configuration

![[Media/Chem/1 Structure/1.1/3 electron configuration/successive ionisation energies for al.png|800]]

the figure above shows an increase in successive ionisation energies. due to:
- increasing attraction between increasingly positive ion and the negative electrons
- decreasing distance between the nucleus and the electron (each subsequent energy level is closer to the nucleus)
- less nuclear shielding with each successive removal



a closer look at the electrons in the n=2 energy level gives evidence for sublevels in the atom

![[Media/Chem/1 Structure/1.1/3 electron configuration/closer look at ionisation energies for electrons in n=2 level of al.png|800]]

- the jump between the 9th and 10th ionisation energy shows that the 10th and 11th electron is more difficult to remove than would be expected from the pattern of previous electrons
- this suggests that the 2nd energy level is divided into 2 sublevels

also, take note of the slight difference between the 6th and 7th ionisation energies
- this is due to the particular stability of half-filled orbitals
- electrons in doubly-occupied orbitals repel each other, and so is easier to remove than an electron in a half-filled orbital


###### successive ionisation energies of the transition elements

one of the key features of transition metals is the wide range of oxidation states that the metals display in their compounds

- i.e. calcium only shows the +2 state, while titanium shows the +4, +3, and +2 states

the $\ce{Ca^{3+}}$ ion is energetically unstable as there is large jump in ionisation energy as the third electron is removed from the inner 3p orbital

however, for titanium, the increase in successive energies is more gradual as the 3d and 4s orbitals are close in energy (and so follows)

a large jump occurs between the 4th and 5th ionisation energies of titanium, as the inner 3p electron is removed, so titanium does not form the +5 state

$\ce{\text{Ca: }1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{6} 3s^{2} 3p^{6} 4s^{2}}$
$\ce{\text{Ti: }1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{6} 3s^{2} 3p^{6} 3d^{2} 4s^{2}}$

###### trends in first ionisation energy across periods account for the existence of main energy levels and sublevels in atoms

![[Media/Chem/1 Structure/1.1/3 electron configuration/first ionisation energy trends graphical.png|800]]

- ionisation energies generally increase from left to right across a period
	- this is due to the increase of nuclear charge
	- the electrons are removed from the same main energy level, but there is an increase in the force of electrostatic attraction
- ionisation energy decreases down a group as a new energy level, which is further from the nucleus, is occupied
- there are regular discontinuities in transition metals, which is explored in Structure 3.1

##### challenge questions
7. A more accurate value for the convergence limit can also be found by plotting a graph of the frequencies of the lines against $\frac{1}{n^{2}}$. Determine the ionisation energy of hydrogen using this method and explain why this method is more accurate.

![[Media/Chem/1 Structure/1.1/3 electron configuration/more accurate approximation of frequency of ionisation of hydrogen atom.png|800]]

calculated 1313.12454kJ/mol. pretty close since the line of best fit was eyeballed
the points better fit a straight line than the other graph shown above
