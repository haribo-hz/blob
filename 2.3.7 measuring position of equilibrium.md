Reactivity 2.3.7 - the equilibrium constant and Gibbs energy change, $\Delta G$, can both be used to measure the position of an equilibrium reaction  
  
$$  
\Delta G^{\ominus }=-RT\ln K  
$$  
the sign of $\Delta G$ is used to predict the spontaneity of the reaction at a specific composition  
$$  
\begin{align}  
&\Delta G=\text{negative}\implies\text{reaction proceeds in forward direction} \\  
&\Delta G=\text{positive}\implies\text{reaction proceeds in the backward direction} \\  
&\Delta G=0\implies\text{reaction is at equilibrium}  
\end{align}  
$$

\Delta G^{\ominus }=-RT\ln K

###### rate of reaction and equilibrium  
the magnitude of $K$ gives no information on the rate of reaction.  
  
considering a reaction that is assumed to occur in a single step: (see [2.2.6, 2.2.7 and 2.2.8 reaction mechanisms](uch,%20how%20fast%20and%20how%20far/2.2%20the%20rate%20of%20chemical%20change/2.2.6,%202.2.7%20and%202.2.8%20reaction%20mechanisms.md))  
$$  
\ce{A +B<=>C +D}  
$$  
only in this case, the rate laws can be written from the stoichiometry of the reaction:  
$$  
\begin{align}  
\text{rate of forward reaction}&=k\ce{[A][B]} \\  
\text{rate of backward reaction}&=k'\ce{[C][D]}  
\end{align}  
$$  
where $k=$ rate constant for the forward reaction and $k'=$ rate constant for the backward reaction  
  
the equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is:  
$$  
K=\ce{\frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}}  
$$  
at equilibrium, the rate of forward reaction is the same as the rate of backward reaction, so:  
$$  
\begin{array}  
\\k\ce{[A][B]}=k'\ce{[C][D]} \\  
\frac{k}{k'}=\ce{\frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}}\text{ or }K=\frac{k}{k'}  
\end{array}  
$$  
  
the equilibrium constant is the ratio of the rate constants of forward and backward reactions.  
- if $k\gg k'\implies K$ is large and reaction progresses towards completion  
- if $k\ll k'\implies K$ is small and the reaction barely takes place  
- increasing the concentration of reactants increases the rate of the forward reaction. following le chatelier's principle, $K$ stays constant  
- adding a catalyst increases the values of $k$ and $k'$ by the same factor, so $K$ stays constant  
- from the Arrhenius equation, $k=Ae^{-\frac{E_{{\text{a}}}}{RT}}$, $E_{\text{a}}$ for the forward and backward reactions is different, so they are differently affected by **temperature**  
	- for an endothermic reaction where $E_{\text{a}}(\text{forwards})>E_{\text{a}}(\text{backwards})$, increase in temperature has a greater effect on increasing $k$ than $k'$, so $K$ increases as temperature increases
