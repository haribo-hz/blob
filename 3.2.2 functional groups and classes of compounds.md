Structure 3.2.2 - functional groups give characteristic physical and chemical properties to a compound. organic compounds are divided into classes according to the functional groups present in their molecules  
  
halogeno, hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, alkoxy, amino, amido, ester, phenyl  
  
**functional groups** are atoms, or groups of atoms, that are present in organic compounds responsible for its physical properties and chemical reactivity  
  
compounds that contain the same functional group belong to the same **class**

**saturated** compounds only contain single bonds between carbons  
**unsaturated** compounds contain double or triple bonds  
  
a **reaction pathway** is the steps (chemical reactions) taken from one species to another
