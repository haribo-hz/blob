Structure 3.1.4 - trends in properties of elements down a group include the increasing metallic character of group 1 elements and the decreasing non-metallic character of group 17 elements

###### group 1: alkali metals
chemical properties:
- reactive metals
- reactivity increases down the group
- form ionic compounds
physical properties:
- conductive of electricity and heat
- low density
- lustrous when not oxidised

named due to reaction with water producing hydroxide ions (a proton acceptor)
$$\begin{align}
&\ce{2K(s)\+2H_{2}O(l)\to2KOH(aq)\+H_{2}(g)} \\
&\ce{2K(s)\+2H_{2}O(l)\to2K+(aq)\+2OH-(aq)\+H_{2}(g)}
\end{align}$$
###### group 17: halogens
chemical properties:
- reactive non-metals
- reactivity decreases down the group
- form ionic compounds and covalent compounds
physical properties:
- coloured
- show gradual change from gases to liquid solids

exist as diatomic molecules $\ce{X_{2}}$

reactivity explained by readiness to accept electrons

**displacement reactions**
the relative reactivity can be seen by placing them in competition for an extra electron eg
$$\ce{2KBr(aq)\+Cl_{2}(aq)\to2KCl(aq)\+Br_{2}(aq)}$$
a chlorine nucleus has a stronger attraction for an electron than a bromine nucleus, so it takes the electron from the bromide ion, forming the chloride ion.
