Structure 3.2.5 - 'IUPAC' nomenclature refers to a set of rules used by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry to apply systematic names to organic and inorganic compounds  
  
1. identify longest straight chain of carbon atoms  
  
| number of carbon atoms | stem |  
| ---------------------- | ---- |  
| 1                      | meth |  
| 2                      | eth  |  
| 3                      | prop |  
| 4                      | but  |  
| 5                      | pent |  
| 6                      | hex  |  
| 7                      | set  |  
| 8                      | oct  |  
| 9                      | non  |  
| 10                     | dec  |  
  
2. identify the functional group  
3. identify side chains  
  
###### esters  
formed when alkyl group of an alcohol replaces the hydrogen of a carboxylic acid in a condensation reaction:  
$$\ce{R-COOH +R'OH\to R-COO-R' +H_{2}O}$$  
- prefix: alkyl group of alcohol   
- stem: parent acid  
  
methanoic acid + ethanol â†’ ethyl methanoate  
  
###### ethers  
consist of 2 alkyl chains linked by an oxygen atom  
$$\ce{R-O-R'}$$  
- stem: longer chain, retains alkane name  
- prefix: shorter chain, given the prefix alkoxy
