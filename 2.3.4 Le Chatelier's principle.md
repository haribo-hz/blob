Reactivity 2.3.4 - Le Ch√¢telier's principle enables the prediction of the qualitative effects of changes in concentration, temperature and pressure to a system at equilibrium  
  
*a system at equilibrium when subjected to a change will respond in such a way as to minimise the effect of the change*  
  
| effect of     | change in position of equilibrium | change in value of $K$ |  
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |  
| concentration | changes                           | no change              |  
| pressure      | changes if gases are involved     | no change              |  
| temperature   | changes                           | changes                |  
| catalyst      | no change                         | no change              |  
  
###### catalysts  
- catalysts increase the rate of chemical reaction  
- both rates (forward and reverse) of reaction are increased equally  
- have no effect on the position of the equilibrium  
  
###### concentration  
| change            | equilibrium shift    |  
| ----------------- | -------------------- |  
| reactant increase | right, less reactant |  
| reactant decrease | left, more reactant  |  
| product increase  | left, less product   |  
| product decrease  | right, more product  |  
  
if all other conditions stay the same, the equilibrium constant is **not affected** by any changes in concentration of the reactants or products  
  
###### pressure  
  
| change   | equilibrium shift                                            |  
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |  
| increase | less gas (direction with smaller number of molecules of gas) |  
| decrease | more gas (direction with larger number of molecules of gas)  |  
  
if all other conditions stay the same, the equilibrium constant is **not affected** by any changes in the pressure of the reactants and products  
  
if there are the same number of gas molecules on either side of the reaction, changes in pressure will not change the position of the equilibrium  
  
###### temperature  
| change   | equilibrium shift        |  
| -------- | ------------------------ |  
| increase | to endothermic direction |  
| decrease | to exothermic direction  |  
  
**==TEMPERATURE CAUSES THE VALUE OF THE EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT TO CHANGE==**  
  
changes in temperature have a different effect on the rates of the forward and backward reactions due to their different activation energies.  
  
###### industrial processes  
- when conditions of industrial processes are chosen, le chatelier's principle can be used to predict the conditions that would cause the equilibrium to lie towards the products, giving a high equilibrium yield  
- the kinematics of the reaction must also be considered as the rate of reaction needs to be sufficiently fast  
  
for example: a reversible reaction whose forward reaction is exothermic  
- according to le chatelier's principle, lower temperatures would produce a higher equilibrium yield  
- however, higher temperatures would give a faster rate of reaction  
- a compromise temperature is used which gives a **lower yield**, but is made more quickly  
- a catalyst can be added to speed up rate of production  
  
recycling of unconverted reactants is commonly used in industrial processes, and allows processes with low equilibrium yield to be made commercially viable  
  
###### heterogeneous equilibria  
le chatelier's principle can also be applied to heterogeneous equilibria  
  
for example, in a carbonated soft drink, an equilibrium exists between the dissolved $\ce{CO_{2}}$ and the gaseous $\ce{CO_{2}}$  
$$  
\ce{CO_{2}(g)<=>CO_{2}(aq)}  
$$  
when the bottle is opened, some $\ce{CO_{2}}(g)$ escapes, so the equilibrium shifts to the left to reduce the effect of the change. thus, bubbles of $\ce{CO_{2}(g)}$ are observed.  
  
##### challenge questions  
4. use information from this section to explain why there is very little $\ce{NO}$ in the atmosphere under ordinary conditions, and why severe air pollution is often characterised by a brownish haze  
  
  
> [!NOTE] INFO  
> the reaction $\ce{N_{2}(g) +O_{2}(g)<=>2NO(g)}$ takes place in motor vehicles where the heat released by combustion of the fuel is sufficient to cause the nitrogen and oxygen gases from the air to combine. unfortunately, the product, $\ce{NO}$, is toxic, and, worse still, quickly becomes converted into other toxins that form the components of acid rain and smog. it is therefore of great interest to vehicle manufacturers to find ways of lowering the temperature during combustion in order to reduce the production of $\ce{NO}$ in the reaction above.  
  
the value for $K$ at $298\pu{K}$ for the reaction $\ce{N_{2}(g) +O_{2}(g)<=>2NO(g)}$ is extremely low, so the equilibrium mixture lies to the left with almost no production of $\ce{NO}$. however, at higher temperatures, such as in vehicle exhaust fumes, the reaction shifts to the right and a higher concentration of $\ce{NO}$ is produced. this gas is easily oxidised in the air, producing the brown gas $\ce{NO2}$ which is responsible for the brownish haze $\ce{2NO(g) +O_{2}(g)\to 2NO_{2}(g)}$  
  
5. consider the atom economy of the Haber process described here using the formula:  
$$  
\ce{N_{2}(g) +3H_{2}(g)<=>2NH_{3}(g)}  
$$  
$$  
\text{\% atom economy}=\frac{\text{molar mass of desired product}}{\text{molar mass of all reactants}}  
$$  
  
	explain how the atom economy is different from the reaction yield  
  
the atom economy is 100%, since there is only 1 product. the reaction yield refers to the amount of product obtained for the amount of reactant used. since this is a reversible reaction, the reaction yield will be lower than 100%
