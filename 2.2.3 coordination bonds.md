Structure 2.2.3 - a coordination bond is a covalent bond in which both the electrons of the shared pair originate from the same atom.  
  
sometimes the bond forms by both the electrons in the pair originating from the same atom. an arrow on the head of the bond is used to show a coordination bond, with direction indicating the origin of the electrons.

once coordination bonds are formed, they are no different from other covalent bonds.  
  
###### interesting  
draw a Lewis formula of ammonia boron trifluoride ($\ce{NH_{3}BF_{3}}$) and show the coordination bond using an arrow.
